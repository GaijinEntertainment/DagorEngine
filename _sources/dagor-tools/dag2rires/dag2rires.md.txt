# dag2riRes

## Overview

The dag2riRes tool is used for the following purposes:

- Converting `.dag` files into `.composit.blk` files.
- Generating multiple `.dag` files from objects within a single `.dag` file.

The tool uses two key files:

- `dag2riRes-dev.exe`
- `dag2riRes-dev.pdb`

## Usage Recommendation

For ease of use, it is recommended to create a separate directory where you can
copy the tool. Avoid placing this directory within the project resources, as
temporary files can accumulate there, potentially disrupting the build process
and generating errors in the editor logs. While these issues are usually minor
and can be resolved by routine cleanup, in cases like research or iterative
testing, where frequent exporting, testing, and deleting is necessary, it is
better to keep the tool in a dedicated directory. In the created directory,
duplicate the `.exe` and `.pdb` files.

## Generating a `.composit.blk` File

To generate a `.composit.blk` file:

1. In 3ds Max or Blender, either create a new object if it is not yet available
   in the asset database, or import it from an existing `.dag` file.
2. Name the object either after the original `.dag` file from which you imported
   the geometry or after the `.dag` file you want to generate from the object
   using dag2riRes.
3. Add a three-digit suffix such as `_000`.
4. If you assign the suffix `_origin` to any object in the scene, its pivot
   point will be used as the zero-coordinate in the resulting composite file.

   ```{note}
   If the `.dag` file being processed with dag2riRes lacks a node named
   `*_origin`, the pivot in the resulting composite file will not match the
   pivot of the original `.dag`, and will be offset instead.
   ```
5. It is recommended to clone similar geometry in the scene as a reference (or
   instance).
6. Export the `.dag` scene to the directory containing the dag2riRes tool.
7. The composite file will be generated in the root directory, next to the
   executable file.

```

## Rules for Generating Individual `.dag` Files

When generating individual `.dag` files:

- `.dag` files will be created based on similar names. For a set of similarly
  named objects in the scene, only one `.dag` file will be generated based on
  the first object in the numerical order.

  For example, from the objects `test_geometry_001`, `test_geometry_127`, and
  `test_geometry_origin`, only one `.dag` file will be created, named
  `test_geometry`, based on the first object (`test_geometry_001`).

- `.dag` files will automatically be assigned a `.lod00` suffix; no other
  suffixes are supported.

- The `.dag` files will be located in the `/simple_dags/p_RendInst` directory.

- `.rendinst.blk` files will be generated alongside the `.dag` files, but they
  are generally not useful.

## Running the dag2riRes

To run `dag2riRes-dev.exe`, it is recommended to use FAR. Upon launching, the
log will display a brief instruction:

<img src="_images/dag2rires_01.png" alt="Running the dag2riRes" align="center">

Enter the command in the command line. At a minimum, you need to specify the
name of the `.dag` file you are processing and the target directory. For
example:

```text
dag2riRes-dev.exe -s:test.dag -d:simple_dags
```

All other parameters are optional.
