# Building Resources

*Resource build process* refers to the process of packaging all game assets –
including models, textures, levels, and their associated settings and game logic
– into binary files. This approach helps reduce the number of files that need to
be downloaded, speeding up the download process while keeping the data volume
constant. It also protects our assets from being exploited by players for
unintended purposes.

The game itself does not interact directly with the raw assets like models,
textures, or level settings that we create. Instead, it only interacts with the
compiled binary files. When a level is loaded, the necessary packages are
fetched, decompressed, and the required information is extracted from them.

This article provides an overview of how to build assets, levels, and settings.

## Parameters in `.folder.blk` Affecting the Building Process

Resource build process is governed by the rules defined in `.folder.blk` files.

```{seealso}
For more information, see
[.folder.blk](../../assets/all-about-blk/folder_blk.md).
```

For example, the following block specifies compression parameters for `.tiff`
textures.

```text
virtual_res_blk{
  find:t="^(.*)\.tiff$"  // search for any .tiff files
  className:t="tex"      // assign the "texture" class
  contents{              // processing details
    convert:b=yes;fmt:t="DXT1|DXT5"  // convert; use DXT1 or DXT5 format (if alpha is present)
    mipFilter:t="filterKaiser";mipFilterAlpha:r=40;mipFilterStretch:r=2 // mipmap compression using
                                     // the Kaiser filter (sharpens); with two parameters
    addrU:t="wrap";addrV:t="wrap"    // define texture tiling behavior, wrap = repeat for repeating textures.
    hqMip:i=0;mqMip:i=1;lqMip:i=2    // define the displayed mip level based on graphics quality;
                                     // hq (high quality) uses the original texture,
                                     // mq uses mip level 1 (50% compression), lq uses mip level 2 (75% compression).
  }
}
```

There are numerous such processing blocks. Below, we'll examine the key ones.

## Global Export Parameters

```text
export{
  package:t="*" // Specify the package to which the asset will be built
                // (a package is the highest level of asset grouping)
  forcePackage:t="*" // Some packages might be automatically renamed by hardcoded logic.
                     // This parameter enforces a specific name. Use this if you want to
                     // ensure that certain assets are built into only one location.
  ddsxTexPackPrefix:t="tanks/" // Specify the directory in the built resources where
                               // texture packs will be stored (a pack is the next level of grouping within a package).
                               // In this example, texture packs for tanks will be built
                               // into the "tanks" directory rather than the general directory.
  ddsxTexPack:t="*name_src"    // Specify the name of the texture pack. If "*name_src" is used,
                               // the name will be derived from the directory containing the textures.
  gameResPack:t="aces.grp" // Specify the name of the resource pack. If "*name_src" is used,
                           // the name will be derived from the folder containing the textures.
  splitNotSeparate:b=true  // Indicate that textures should not be split between the base client and the full client.
                           // In the base client, textures are downscaled to 512px so players can download a smaller
                           // amount of data and start playing sooner. To maintain visual quality, some textures, like
                           // those for tanks or hangars, are not downscaled but kept at normal quality. This flag is
                           // set to true to prevent downscaling. The default is false, and it can be omitted.
}
```

These are just a few examples. Let's delve into the primary parameters.

## About Packs and Packages

The hierarchy of resources can be illustrated as follows:

<img src="_images/building_resources_01.jpg" alt="Hierarchy of resources" align="center" width="40em">

In essence, a project can contain several packages, and each package can include
multiple packs.

### What Is a Package?

A *package* typically serves as a container for resources that we want to
distribute to or remove from the player's environment. For example, we might
bundle a specific location and its assets into a package for a particular event.
Players download it, enjoy the event for a week, and once the event concludes,
the package is removed from their resources.

Packages can also be used to release or sell add-ons. Instead of requiring
players to download 20&nbsp;GB of resources upfront, they can start with a
minimal setup and quickly get into the game. Later, they can purchase additional
content and download the necessary data from the relevant package.

```{seealso}
For more information, see
[Packages](./packages.md).
```

### What Is a Pack?

A *pack* is a component of a package where the assets are actually built. The
logic for dividing assets into packs is straightforward:

- When a location is loaded, the minimum possible number of packs should be
  fetched to optimize loading times.
- Each pack should ideally be between 10&nbsp;MB to 100&nbsp;MB (with
  100&nbsp;MB being the absolute maximum) to ensure efficient unpacking.

Generally, we group similar assets together; for example, all vehicle props
might go into a pack named `vehicles`. Defensive structures like pillboxes,
trenches, bunkers, and barricades might be grouped into a pack called
`fortifications`.

If a pack becomes too large, we break it down into smaller groups. For example,
vehicles could be further divided into packs such as `buses`, `trucks`, and
`cars`.

## Local Build

When you create a new asset, it needs to be tested locally in the game. The
local client, like the player's client, only understands built resources, so
they need to be built before testing.

There are three types of builds:

1. **Full Build**: builds all resources.
2. **Partial Pack Build**: builds the specific pack containing the resource you
   need. This method is used when only a few assets have been modified – quick
   and efficient.
3. **Partial Package Build**: builds an entire package (a set of packs).
   Although this is a longer process, it can be more convenient in some cases,
   such as in daNetGame-based games, where packaging the resources this way
   might be preferable to building individual packs.

## Local Full daBuild

The daBuild is a program executed via the `dabuild.cmd` batch file.

```{important}
Running `dabuild.cmd` will build all resources – this process can take hours. If
you only need to build a single resource for quick testing, use
`dabuild_test.bat` instead.
```

### Building and Errors

In theory, all assets should be error-free. However, asset management initially
relied heavily on manual checks, leading to human error and allowing issues to
slip through. Over time, more automated checks were added to daBuild, which
means that older assets that previously built without problems might now trigger
errors. If an error occurs while building a pack, the build process for that
pack is halted, and subsequent assets are not built. Errors are only detected
during the build process, but they also interrupt it, making it time-consuming
to identify and fix issues across all assets within a pack.

To address this, the `-keep_building_after_error` flag was introduced. If the
previous build resulted in errors, you can add this flag at the end of the batch
file command to allow daBuild to continue building all resources while logging
the errors.

```{note}
The `-keep_building_after_error` flag should not be used to ignore errors. The
build process for specific assets will still be interrupted, but it will move on
to the next asset in the pack rather than stopping at the first error. Once
you've collected error data, fix the assets and run the build without this flag
to ensure that daBuild completes successfully without issues.
```

### Local Pack Build

```{important}
Building packs with daBuild will compile all packs matching a specified pattern.
For example, if you have a `vehicles` pack and a `vehicles_modern` pack,
building `vehicles` will compile both packs unless you specify the exact pack
extension (e.g., `vehicles.grp` to target only that pack).

Also, note that daBuild will build packs based on the package name. For example,
if you have several packs within the `main` package and you run a build using
the `main` pattern, it will build all packs within the `main` package. **This
builds all packs within the `main` package, not the `main` package itself.**

This happens because the final pack names always include the package name as a
prefix. For example, the `vehicles` pack in the `main` package will ultimately
be named `main_vehicles`.
```

To build a specific pack, open `dabuild_test.bat` in any text editor, and you
will see a line like this:

```text
..\..\tools\dagor3_cdk\bin64\dabuild-dev.exe -target:PC ..\application.blk -packs_re:usa_gm -Q
```

Replace `usa_gm` with the name of the pack you need to build. The pack is
determined by the nearest `.folder.blk` file to the asset, containing lines
like:

```text
export{
  ddsxTexPack:t="gm_lvl_assets.dxp.bin"
  gameResPack:t="gm_lvl_assets.grp"
}
```

The `gm_lvl_assets` is an example of the pack name into which the resources will
be built. It may vary – refer to your specific setup.

```{important}
Notice that there are two types of packs:

- `ddsxTexPack`: exports textures
- `gameResPack`: exports models

It's possible for textures to be exported to one pack and models to another.
For example:

    ```
    export{
      ddsxTexPack:t="gm_lvl_assets.dxp.bin"
      gameResPack:t="locations.grp"
    }
    ```

You need to build the packs corresponding to the resources you've modified. If
you've changed textures, build the texture pack. If you've changed models, build
the model pack. If both were changed, build both packs.
```

## Local Package Build

Unlike packs, packages are more comprehensive and refer to self-contained
volumes of resources that can be enabled or disabled with a "toggle".

For example, in War Thunder:

- `pkg_main` (or simply `*`): the default package where all assets are exported.
- `pkg_dev`: contains assets that should be built but not distributed to
  players.
- `tomoe`: a package for modifying certain symbols in countries where their
  original form is prohibited.
- Event packages are also occasionally used.

In daNetGame-based games, each location is its own package, which can be
distributed to players independently.

In a `.folder.blk` file, the package entry looks like this:

```text
export{
  package:t="tomoe"
}
```

In War Thunder, local package builds are not common, as there are few packages,
and packs are usually built instead. However, in daNetGame-based games, this is
an extremely useful feature. There are two options for such builds.

### Option 1: Building a Specific Package

In the `daBuild` batch file, write:

```text
..\..\tools\dagor3_cdk\bin64\dabuild-dev.exe -target:PC ..\application.blk -package:package_name -Q
```

Replace `package_name` with the name of the package you need to build. This will
build the entire package with validation and checks.

```{note}
Package builds target specific packages, unlike packs, which work based on
patterns. This isn't usually an issue unless you're trying to build textures.

For example, `package_name` and `package_name_hq` (high-quality textures used
for close-up views) are different packages. Building the package with
`-package:package_name` will only compile standard textures, not high-quality
ones. This could result in your changes appearing in low-quality textures but
reverting when viewed up close, as the high-quality textures haven't been
updated.

To avoid this, you should either:

- sequentially build both packages using one batch file:
  `-package:package_name -package:package_name_hq`

or

- create two separate batch files: one for the main resource package (non-HQ
  textures) and another specifically for HQ textures.
```

### Option 2: Building a Specific Package and Its Dependencies

In daNetGame-based games, packages often have cross-references. When something
changes in a "common" package, you need to ensure that everything works
correctly in all other packages that reference it. Instead of doing a full build
(which is very time-consuming), you can build the "common" package along with
its dependent packages, which is much faster.

To do this, write the following in the `daBuild` batch file:

```text
..\..\tools\dagor3_cdk\bin64\dabuild-dev.exe -target:PC ..\application.blk -package_and_deps:package_name -Q
```

The `package_and_deps` refers to the package and its dependencies.

## Toggling Packages in settings.blk

Occasionally, you may need to enable or disable packages to test specific
scenarios (for example, disabling a package to verify that the game runs without
it). This is configured in the `settings.blk` file.

```{seealso}
For more information, see
[settings.blk](../../assets/all-about-blk/config_and_settings_blk).
```

For all projects, after modifying the package list, you must rebuild the
`.vromfs.bin` files.

In War Thunder, packages are enabled or disabled in the file located at
`<engine_root>/<project_name>/develop/gameBase/_pc/settings.blk`:

```text
addons{
  folder:t = "content.hq/hq_tex"
  folder:t = "content.hq/pkg_cockpits"
  folder:t = "content/pkg_china"
  folder:t = "content.hq/pkg_china_hq"
  folder:t = "content/pkg_dev"
  folder:t = "content.hq/pkg_dev_hq"
  folder:t = "content/hc_pacific"
  folder:t = "content/pkg_user"
  folder:t = "content/pkg_local"
  folder:t = "content/tomoe"
  folder:t = "content.hq/tomoe_hq"
  folder:t = "content.hq/uhq_vehicles"
  folder:t = "content.hq/uhq_aircraft"
  folder:t = "content.hq/uhq_environment"
}
addons_no_check{
  folder:t = "content.hq/hq_tex"
  folder:t = "content.hq/pkg_cockpits"
  folder:t = "content/pkg_china"
  folder:t = "content.hq/pkg_china_hq"
  folder:t = "content/pkg_dev"
  folder:t = "content.hq/pkg_dev_hq"
  folder:t = "content/hc_pacific"
  folder:t = "content/pkg_user"
  folder:t = "content/pkg_local"
  folder:t = "content/tomoe"
  folder:t = "content.hq/tomoe_hq"
  folder:t = "content.hq/uhq_vehicles"
  folder:t = "content.hq/uhq_aircraft"
  folder:t = "content.hq/uhq_environment"
}
```

To disable a package, simply comment out the relevant lines in both blocks and
rebuild `.vromfs.bin` files.

It's important to note that this file is responsible only for enabling or
disabling packages within the game; it does not handle the creation of packages.
The requirement for a package to be built by daBuild is defined in the
`application.blk` file within the `packages{}` block.

```{seealso}
For more information, see
[application.blk](../../assets/all-about-blk/application_blk.md).
```

## Local Build of a Specific Asset

The `daBuild` command with the `-build:<asset>[:<out_file>]` parameter allows
you to build a single asset into the specified file. This command does not
update packages, meaning the updated asset will not be added to any package.

## Local Resource Build in Asset Viewer

Resources can also be built using the [Asset
Viewer](../asset-viewer/asset-viewer/asset_viewer.md), which often speeds up
the process since `daBuild` via batch files can sometimes lag unpredictably.

```{seealso}
For more information on how to build using Asset Viewer, see
[Asset Viewer: Building Assets](../asset-viewer/asset-viewer/asset_viewer.md#building-assets).
```

## Local Vromfs Build

*VROMFS* stands for "Virtual Read-Only Memory File System". Essentially,
[vromfs](vromfs.md) files are the "virtual configuration disk" for our game.
They contain all the game's operational settings that aren't hard-coded.

When creating assets, you need to build vromfs primarily when you're configuring
asset destruction or fine-tuning the behavior of in-game vehicles. In other
scenarios, vromfs building is typically unnecessary.

It's crucial to remember that, by default, vromfs are delivered over the network
at the start of each mission, allowing for different settings per mission. If
you want to test something locally, ensure that your `config.blk` file has the
following line in the `debug{}` block: `offlineBinaries:b=yes`. Alternatively,
you can use `disableNetwork:b=yes` if network features are irrelevant to you.
For added security, you might want to include both.

### Methods to Build Vromfs

1. **Using `create_vrsroms.bat`**

   The `create_vrsroms.bat` file located in the
   `<engine_root>/<project_name>/develop/gameBase` directory.

   This method is useful because it immediately indicates if there's an issue
   with the settings by throwing an error.

   Additionally, it provides a local log (`log_vrom`) in the same directory,
   which helps you identify and resolve any problems.

2. **Using `aces_dev.exe`**

   Technically, this tool does not build vromfs. However, if you have
   `vromfsPriority:b=no` set in the `debug{}` block of your `config.blk`, all
   configuration files will be read directly from `develop/gameBase` instead of
   from vromfs.

   This approach offers several advantages: there's no need to wait for vromfs
   building after each change, and errors are logged in a more readable format.

   Additionally, this method allows you to add the powerful
   `trackEnvChanges:b=yes` line to your `config.blk`, enabling you to tweak
   settings directly in-game. Although this doesn't work for all settings, it's
   particularly helpful for adjusting weather or visual elements, as you can see
   the changes in real-time without restarting the client.

Choose the method based on your experience. The in-game approach might be less
convenient, but sometimes it's essential to ensure everything behaves exactly as
it would in production.

## Local Build of Resources and Vromfs in the Open daEditor and Client

You can build resources and [vromfs](vromfs.md) while the
[daEditor](../daeditor/daeditor/daeditor.md) is open (though resource building
might cause the [daEditor](../daeditor/daeditor/daeditor.md) to crash).

However, resources and vromfs cannot be built while the client is open.

If you find that resources aren't building after you've closed the client – or
they seem to build, but the changes aren't reflected in-game – open the Task
Manager and terminate any lingering `aces_dev.exe` processes.

## Local Level Export

If you're developing in-game vehicles that are loaded via missions, you can skip
this section.

However, if you're creating objects for maps, you'll need to place them on the
map and export the level to test them in-game. This process is done via the
[daEditor](../daeditor/daeditor/daeditor.md).

Level export is necessary when:

- You're working with prefabs. Prefabs are only included in the game during
  level re-export.
- You've added a new asset that wasn't previously on the level or removed
  something from the location.
- Something has changed in object generation, and their placement needs to be
  updated.

If you're only modifying render instances or textures, there's no need to
re-export the level – doing so would just waste time.

Once you have placed all your objects, save the level and follow these steps:

1. Open the **Project** menu.
2. Select **Export to Game (PC format)** (if needed).
3. Click **OK** on all subsequent dialog boxes.
4. Save the level binary file.
5. After the level build is complete, launch the game and verify the objects.
