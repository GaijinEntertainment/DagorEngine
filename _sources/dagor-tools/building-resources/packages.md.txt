# Packages

## How It Works

The rules that define which packages exist in the game and their dependencies
are specified in the `application.blk` file within the `packages{}` block.

```{seealso}
For more information, see
[application.blk](../../assets/all-about-blk/application_blk.md).
```

**Example:**

```text
pkg_dev{                         // package name
  PC:b=yes; iOS:b=no; and:b=no;  // platforms
  destSuffix:t="/../content.hq"  // if the package should be placed in content.hq (needed for HQ versions)
  "PC~~dedicatedServer":b=yes    // required on dedicated servers (HQ versions are not needed, standard ones are)
  allow_patch:b=false   // should patching be allowed (only disabled for pkg_dev, everything in production is patched)
  always_commit:b=true  // should the rebuild commit changes
  dependencies{         // dependencies
    "*" {base:b=yes;}   // base package
    pkg_cockpits {base:b=yes;}  // cockpit assets
  }
}
```

The `dependencies{}` block indicates that Package A, which specifies a
dependency on Package B, relies on Package B. However, Package B does not depend
on Package A.

## How to Add a New Package

To add a new package, define the new `pkg` in `application.blk`, modify the
necessary `folder.blk` files (export settings for assets), run the [local
build](./building_resources.md#local-build), and ensure that the dependencies
are correct and no errors occur.

```{seealso}
For more information, see
[folder.blk](../../assets/all-about-blk/folder_blk.md).
```

It's not necessary to rebuild the [vromfs](vromfs.md) files after defining a new
package.

For the game to recognize the package content, you must specify it in the
settings file `settings.blk` located at
`<engine_root>/<project_name>/develop/gameBase/_pc/settings.blk`. Add the
package paths in both the `addons{}` and `addons_no_check{}` blocks.

[settings.blk](../../assets/all-about-blk/config_and_settings_blk.md).
