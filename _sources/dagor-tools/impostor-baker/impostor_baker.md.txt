# Impostor Baker

## Overview

The purpose of this tool is to generate impostor textures of rendinst models to
be exported to game resource packages.

## Local Workflow

The tool is a separate executable. The existing daBuild is console application,
thus it does not support rendering assets.

The generation of the impostor textures takes place before the building of the
assets, so the generated textures get exported as well

1. Generate the impostor textures.
2. Build the resources with daBuild (to test them locally).
3. Commit changes:
   - `.folder.blk`, which is used for the trees,
   - the generated textures (there are 3 per rendinst),
   - `riImpostors.bin` files, which are modified (found in
     <content_folder>/<package_folder>/res/).

## Local Workflow: Quick Start

1. To enable baked impostors, look in the `.folder.blk` file for such virtual
   assets:

   `virtual_res_blk{ find:t="^(.*bush.*)\.lod00\.dag$"...}`

2. Replace the line

   `lod { range:r=1000; fname:t="../dynamic_imposter.lod01.dag";}`

   to

   `lod { range:r=1000; fname:t="../billboard_octagon_impostor.lod01.dag";}`

3. Add the `impostor{}` block (check the end of the page for more details on
   this).

4. Run `daImpostor.cmd` in `<game_folder>/develop/`

5. Run daBuild.

   Necessary packages (or just build everything) are:
   - `vegetation.grp` (or wherever the affected trees are exported to)
   - `<trees_foldername>_impostors.dxp` (there could be more if there are trees
     in different folders)
   - `.grp` for the `impostor_data.impostorData.blk` file. The location is
     specified in `application.blk` file: `assets/impostor_data_folder:t=...`

6. (optional) Export level binaries.

   The game runs without this, but the rotation palettes won't be available.
   Without this step, there will be a logerr when a level is loaded. It is not
   dangerous, safe to ignore, but the level will look slightly different after
   level binary export.

   When uploading stuff to cvs, it has to include all the generated textures +
   `.folder.blk` in the generated impostors folder (<trees_folder>/impostors/);
   and the `impostor_data.impostorData.blk` file, and of course modified the
   `.folder.blk`.

## How to Access the Tool

Here will be description about how to access the tool.

## Impostor Texture Resolution

The texture sizes can be specified in `application.blk` or in `.folder.blk` per
asset.

- In `application.blk`:

  The texture height can be specified either globally or based on world space
  tree height, using quality levels. The width of the texture will be calculated
  based on world space height/width ratio of the tree. Wide trees will have a
  wide texture. For configuration, check the end of this page.

  ```{seealso}
  For more information, see
  [application.blk](../../assets/all-about-blk/application_blk.md).
  ```

- In `.folder.blk`:

  Here the exact resolution can be specified. If only height is specified, width
  will be calculated based on world space height/width ratio of the tree. The
  `impostor{}` block options for `textureWidth` and `textureHeight` correspond
  to the resolution of the entire generated texture, not per slice. The
  generated textures will contain 9 views in a row, but they are compacted.

  ```{seealso}
  For more information, see
  [.folder.blk](../../assets/all-about-blk/folder_blk.md).
  ```

Keep in mind that the option for texture resolutions will apply to the highest,
*hq* texture config. These resolutions should be the ones that the current game
is supposed to use with the highest quality options. Mip offsets are applied for
*mq*, and *lq* and optionally applied for mobile distribution too.

If you want to specify texture quality for specific platforms, the
`impostors/.folder.blk` has to be changed. The generated textures are created
for all platforms. `.folder.blk` can be used to export them with mip offsets.
Until there is no project specific option here, it's better to update
`impostorBaker.cpp` to generate a different default `.folder.blk`.

## How to Use the Tool

### Using the Separate Tool

The tool needs to be executed from the `develop/` directory in order to work. It
needs two mandatory arguments: the path to the `application.blk` and the path to
the root directory:

```text
> G:/dagor2/tools/dagor3_cdk/bin64/impostorBaker-dev.exe ../application.blk -rootdir:G:/dagor2/enlisted/develop [options...]
```

The options are:

- `debug:<value>`: either `classic` or `default`, sets the debugging mode.
- `assets:<asset_name1;asset_name2...>`: asset names can be listed here (of
  type rendinst), separated with `;`. The tool will export these assets.
- `packs:<pack_name1;pack_name2...>`: assets from these packs, which have an
  impostor will be exported.
- `clean:<yes|no>`: can be used to remove all textures that belong to assets
  that no longer exist. Default value: `no`.
- `folderblk:<disabled|dont_replace|replace>`: specifies what to do with the
  `.folder.blk` files found inside the impostor directories:
  - **`disabled`**: never generate or modify these files;
  - **`dont_replace`**: generate `.folder.blk` if it doesn't exist;
  - **`replace`** (default value): always generate or replace existing.

If the assets or packs options are set, only those assets will be generated.
Otherwise all supported assets (rendinst which have an `impostor{}` block). If
invalid arguments are detected the application will print out a help menu with
all these arguments.

The tool will create a directory within each directory containing rendinst that
supports impostors. Textures and a `.folder.blk` file (depending on the
settings) will be placed in this directory upon generation.

```{note}
Don't put anything else in that directory, because it's content is handled
automatically. If the **clean** option is enabled, it will parse all impostor
directories, and all file names inside these directories. It will keep all files
which belong to an existing asset, that supports impostors; it will delete all
textures which match the impostor texture name format, which don't belong to any
such asset; `.folder.blk` files are ignored at this step; if any other file is
found, then the cleaning operation will abort to prevent accidentally deleting
necessary files.
```

### Using the Asset Viewer

```{note}
The impostor textures only appear if they exist when the [Asset
Viewer](../asset-viewer/asset-viewer/asset_viewer.md) starts. If the impostor
textures are generated from the [Asset
Viewer](../asset-viewer/asset-viewer/asset_viewer.md), then they will only
appear in the assets after a restart.
```

Let the image speak for itself:

## How to Enable the Impostor Texture Generation of an Asset

First of all, the asset has to be of type `rendinst`, otherwise the tool will
just skip it.

Add an `impostor{}` block to the content of the virtual asset. The `impostor{}`
block **must be directly inside of the `contents{}` block**, not inside of a
third block. At the moment baked/runtime impostor duality is not supported. It's
not possible to set up different impostor types for different build
configurations, e.g. different platforms. This feature is feasible but has not
been implemented yet.

**Example:**

```text
virtual_res_blk{
  find:t="^(.*tree_tropic_large_.*)\.lod00\.dag$"
  className:t="rendInst"
  contents{
    impostor{
      textureWidth:i=4096
      textureHeight:i=0 // automatically adjust to width, based on asset height (for trees/bushes)
      rotationPaletteSize:i=3
      mipCount:i=0 // 0 means generate all until specified smallest mip size (application.blk)
    }
    //...
  }
}
```

or just simply

```text
virtual_res_blk{
  find:t="^(.*tree_tropic_large_.*)\.lod00\.dag$"
  className:t="rendInst"
  contents{
    impostor{} // autodetect impostor type; use default settings
    //...
  }
}
```

Any of the parameters inside the `impostor{}` block can be left out to use the
default values. The block can also be empty. The tool will generate a texture,
that is composed of slices, which correspond to different viewing angles of the
asset.

- `textureWidth`: X resolution of the entire texture containing 9 slices.
- `textureHeight`: Y resolution of the generated texture = height of a single
  slice.
- `mipCount`: by default (value = `0`) it will generate all mips based on
  `application.blk` settings. Any different value will manually override it. It
  means the total number of mip levels including the base texture.
- `rotationPaletteSize`: the tree will be able to rotate around Y, but only a
  few discrete angles are allowed. For `rotationPaletteSize=3`, possible
  rotations will be 0&deg;, 120&deg;, 240&deg; degrees.

  ```{warning}
  There will be a shadow texture created for every possible rotation for every
  tree.
  ```

- `preshadowsEnabled`: enables preshadows for this asset.
- `crownCenterOffset1`: Point3 offset of transmittance ellipsoid center in
  meters.
- `crownRadOffset1`: Point3 offset of transmittance ellipsoid radius in
  meters.
- `crownCenter2`: Point3 secondary transmittance ellipsoid center in meters.
- `crownRad2`: Point3 secondary transmittance ellipsoid radius in meters.
- `mipOffsets_hq_mq_lq:ip3=0,1,2`: these mip offsets will be exported directly
  to the `.tex.blk` files. These options only affect daBuild.
- `mobileMipOffsets_hq_mq_lq:ip3=0,1,2`: same as `mipOffsets_hq_mq_lq`, except
  it's for mobile platforms. If the project is not built for mobile, then no
  need to specify it.
- `impostorNormalMip:i=5`: there is a way to tell the tool which mip will be
  used for baking the normals for this asset. By default it's `0`.

The default values can be found in:
`prog/gameLibs/publicInclude/rendInst/impostorTextureMgr.h`

## How to Enable Baked Impostors in a New Game

1. Add copy the current `billboard_octagon_impostor.lod01.dag` file to every
   location, where there is a `dynamic_imposter.lod01.dag` file in the assets
   directory. If there is already one, check if it's the same.

2. Enable `impostorData` asset type in `application.blk`:

   - `assets{ types{ type:t="impostorData"}}`
   - `assets{ export{ types{ type:t="impostorData"}}}`

3. Add `assets{impostor{}}` block to the `application.blk`

   - `data_folder:t`: mandatory, pick a location that is exported for the game
     always (not level dependent or something similar). The corresponding `.grp`
     cannot contain any assets that use baked impostors.
   - `splitAt:i`: optional, `splitAt` value generated for impostor textures. It
     will be used to export all impostor textures within the project.
   - `defaultTextureHeight:i`: optional, default texture height for generated
     impostor textures. It can be overwritten in the `virtual_res{}` block.
   - `textureQualityLevels{ qualityLevel{ minHeight:r=; textureHeight:i= }}}`:
     list of texture heights based on world space tree height. `textureHeight`
     will be applied for trees that are at least `minHeight` tall. Multiple
     qualityLevel blocks can be specified.

     ```{important}
     Only one of `defaultTextureHeight` and `textureQualityLevels` can be
     specified at a time.
     ```

   - `mobileMipOffset:i`: optional, if the mobile version of the game requires
     smaller resolution textures than the PC, a mip offset can be applied to
     them using this option. Texture can be generated in PC resolution and the
     mobile will use them with the given mip offset.
   - `normalMipOffset:i`: normal_translucency texture will have a lower
     resolution than the diffuse texture when using this.
   - `aoSmoothnessMipOffset:i`: same as the `normalMipOffset:i`, but for
     ao_smoothness texture.
   - `aoBrightness:r`: brightness of impostor AO effect default: `0.7`.
   - `aoFalloffStart:r`: lower means darker center of impostor AO effect
     (`0`..`1`) default: `0.25`.
   - `aoFalloffStop:r`: lower means darker edge of impostor AO effect (`0..1`)
     default: `1.0`.
   - `preshadowsEnabled:b`: enables or disables preshadows by default for this
     project. It can be overwritten per asset. Preshadows usually improve
     quality at the cost of performance, although they don't work for every
     asset. Default value: `yes`.

  **Example**

  ```text
  impostor{
    data_folder:t="develop/assets/gameres/gameObjects"
    preshadowsEnabled:b=yes
    splitAt:i=256
    mobileMipOffset:i=1
    normalMipOffset:i=1
    aoSmoothnessMipOffset:i=1
    textureQualityLevels{
      qualityLevel{
        minHeight:r=0; textureHeight:i=32
      }
      qualityLevel{
        minHeight:r=4; textureHeight:i=64
      }
      qualityLevel{
        minHeight:r=8; textureHeight:i=128
      }
      qualityLevel{
        minHeight:r=16; textureHeight:i=256
      }
    }
  }
  ```

4. Open the corresponding `gameParams.blk`

5. Remove this line (if exists):

   `enableImpostorTextureManager:b=false (default=yes)`

6. Optionally add this line to disable preshadow compression:

   `enableImpostorPreshadowCompression:b = <yes/no> (default=yes)`

7. Configure the parameters for transmittance approximation for outside of
   cascade0:

  ```text
  treeCrownTransmittance{
    brightness:r    // default = 0.5
    falloffStart:r  // default = 0.01
    falloffStop:r   // default = 1.
    enabled:b       // default = no
  }
  ```

## How to Use ImpostorNormalMip for Smoothness Hack

The idea of hack. At some mip of branches normal texture place a the same
texture, but with fade smoothness channel. After that bake the impostor with
this texture, and as a result we saw in game impostor with less whitish stuff on
the edge. 

1. Set up a mipFade feature for normal texture of branches for vegetation, for
   example you set a 4 mip as faded

   ```{important}
   You should specify mipFade according to swizzling.
   ```

   As shows the example below, here we want mip fade for smoothness channel,
   which stored in alpha channel. But according to swizzling Alpha channel goes
   to Red channel. So we apply mip fade to red channel.

   **Example:**

   Customized mipmap lit color for A channel(smoothness) only for branches
   exclude palms, olives, glossy foliage etc.

     ```text
     virtual_res_blk{
       find:t="^(.*branch.*_n?)\.tif$"
       //exclude glossy foliage here
       className:t="tex"
       contents{
         hqMip:i=1; mqMip:i=2; lqMip:i=3
         convert:b=yes; fmt:t="BC7"
         rebuild_bc67:b=yes
         gamma:r=1
         stubTexTag:t="smooth0_nx_metal0_ny"
         mipFilter:t="filterKaiser"; mipFilterAlpha:r=42; mipFilterStretch:r=2 
         addrU:t="wrap"; addrV:t="wrap"
         hqMip:i=0; mqMip:i=1; lqMip:i=2
         swizzleARGB:t="RAGB"
         mipFade{
           mipFadeColor:p4=1.0,-1,-1,-1
           mipFadeStart:c=0,0,0,0
           mipFadeEnd:c=4,4,4,4
         }
       }
     }
     ```

2. Make an export of this export, to apply changes of mipFade feature.

3. Set up a mip which will be used for sampling, per asset for tree. 

   **Example:**

     ```text
     virtual_res_blk{
       find:t="^(tree_autumn_.*)\.lod00\.dag$"
       className:t="rendInst"
       contents{
         lod{
           range:r=80;
         }
         lod{
           range:r=160;
         }
         lod{
           range:r=1500;
           fname:t="../billboard_octagon_impostor.lod01.dag";
         }
         transition_lod{
           ...
         }
         impostor{
           impostorNormalMip:i=5;
         }
         allowProxyMat:b=yes
       }
     }
     ```

4. Run Impostor Baker, to bake the impostors.

5. Export whole data to the game.
