# dag4blend

## Installation

1. Go to **Edit > Preferences > Add-ons** in Blender.

2. Click small dropdown on the top right corner and choose **Install from Disk...**

<img src="_images/inst_location.png" alt="Installation" align="center">

3. Navigate to the `.zip` file of the add-on.

4. After installation, check the box next to the add-on in the list.

To use add-on properly you need to perform some initial configuration, so do not close
the **Preferences** window yet:

<img src="_images/preferences.png" alt="Preferences" align="center">

The path for **ObjProps presets:** and shader list **dagorShaders.cfg:** can now
be set manually. This feature ensures that updating the add-on does not
overwrite any user-made changes. It is recommended to store presets outside the
add-on directory.

Until the path to an existing directory is specified, the preset menu will not
be displayed. For each project you  work on, you need to specify the path to the
`assets/` directory.

```{note}
Many interface elements have tooltips that appear when you hover the cursor
over them.
```
### Configuring Projects

Some operators of dag4blend need additional info about current game to work properly.
To create new set of properties press **+ ADD Project**.

<img src="_images/inst_projects.png" alt="Projects" align="center">

Every non-configured parameter of new project is marked by **ERROR** icon.

- **name:** how this project will be displayed in "Active Project" dropdown.

- **path:** where all game assets stored. DAGs, textures, composites, proxymats, etc.

- **Shading mode:** shaders behave slightly different between projects. The
  add-on is designed to adapt to two main shader groups: daNetGame-like and War
  Thunder-like shaders.

- **Palettes**: 
    - global palette is used everywhere dy default, unless it's overriden.
    - local palette can be configured per-level and can be used instead of global
      on specific assets.

```{note}
By default, the global and local palettes will be simple red and green fills,
until you specify a path to existing texture.
```

Configured project should have no error icons. When parameters are set,
use lock button to make it non-editable.
It prevents changing properties or project removal by accident.

<img src="_images/inst_projects_configured.png" alt="Project Configured" align="center">

You don't have to always use **Preferences** window to change the active project
or edit its parameters.
Same exact project configurator can be found in the **Scene Properties**:

<img src="_images/inst_scene.png" alt="Scene" align="center">

```{note}
Project parameters are stored in Add-on preferences,
but sometimes they are not being saved on exit automatically.
To ensure that new parameters won't be lost, you can use **Save Preferences** button,
available right in project configurator. Remember, that it's a **global** operator,
which saves all the preferences, not just dag4blend ones.
```

### Experimental Features

This block contains toggles for new tools that are functional but have some
limitations. Currently, it includes only a [Composite Editor](#composite-editor):

<img src="_images/inst_exp_features.png" alt="Experimental Features" align="center">

## Log and Text Editors

Text objects play an important role in this toolset, so it is recommended to add
a text field to your layout or add a new window with just a text field if you
are working with multiple monitors.

<img src="_images/log_text_field.png" alt="Text field" align="center">

The import/export functions (and future ones) write execution information to a
text **log** field.

```{note}
The **log** does not clear itself, so remember to clear it periodically after
ensuring that there are no unchecked errors and warnings. To clear it, you can
simply delete the text object. The next time you need it, the toolset will
create a new one. This approach can be faster than selecting all the lines and
deleting them with `Backspace`/`Delete`.
```

To edit object properties, dagormats, or proxymats as text, the toolset creates
a special text object. The name of the object is provided in the tooltip.

```{seealso}
For more information, see
[Proxymats](../../../../assets/materials/proxymats.md).
```

## Material Setup

For setup material for Dagor Engine, there is separate **dagormat** tab. It
contains several subtabs that can be collapsed when not needed:

<img src="_images/mat_dagormat.png" alt="Dagormat" align="center">

### Main

Here you can choose whether the material is two-sided, and if so, how it
behaves:

<img src="_images/mat_dagormat_main.png" alt="Dagormat - Main" align="center">

- **single_sided**: enables backface culling for triangles with this material.

- **two_sided**: each triangle is rendered from both sides. The shader is
  slightly heavier, but the geometry is lighter. Use this primarily for heavy
  geometry, such as tree crowns.

- **real_two_sided**: in the engine, a single-sided material is uses, but each
  triangle with this material will be duplicated and flipped to be visible from
  the other side. This shader is lighter, but it doubles the mesh weight. It is
  better used on simpler meshes.

Below is a list of **legacy** properties: *ambient*, *specular*, *diffuse*,
*emissive* and *power*. Hover over them to see tooltips describing each
property.

This tab also allows you to select a shader from the available options or
manually enter a value. It is useful if new shaders have been added to the game
but the toolset has not been updated yet.

<img src="_images/mat_dagormat_shader.png" alt="Dagormat - Shader" align="center">

The list of shaders and their possible parameters are taken from
`dagorShaders.cfg`, which by default is located at:
`C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\<version
number>\scripts\addons\dag4blend`.

### Textures

This section lists the textures in use. Indices (matching those stored in `.dag`
files) are available in tooltips. You can copy and paste paths from [Asset
Viewer](../../../asset-viewer/asset-viewer/asset_viewer.md) or Explorer; quotes
will be removed automatically.

<img src="_images/mat_dagormat_textures.png" alt="Dagormat - Textures" align="center">

### Optional

Visual editing of shader parameters. You can manually enter values or select
from a list, similar to how shader selection works.

<img src="_images/mat_dagormat_optional.png" alt="Dagormat - Optional" align="center">

### Tools

Here you can edit the active material in text format.

<img src="_images/mat_dagormat_tools_1.png" alt="Dagormat - Tools" align="center">

<img src="_images/mat_dagormat_tools_2.png" alt="Dagormat - Tools" align="center">

If there is no text editing field, one will be added to the left of the
viewport, otherwise, the text will be opened in the first available text field.

Search is available in two modes: only for the active material or for all
materials in the scene. Switch modes by clicking the text indicating the current
mode.

A correctly specified project is required for search to function properly – when
working on a daNetGame asset, specify **daNetGame**.

- **Find missing...**: finds all textures and all proxymats (if they exist in
  the project). The texture search only affects viewport display and does not
  alter the material path.

- **Rebuild materials**: rebuilds the materials for the viewport.
  Re-uses existing shader nodegroups to save time and filesize.

- **FORCE REBUILD**: same, but also removes all the shader nodegroups from blend file
  and loads new ones from library, to help with updating old scene to the newer add-on version.

- **Update texture paths**: finds non-existent paths and replaces them with
  current ones. Should be used after texture search.

- **Clear texture paths**: removes directory information, leaving only texture
  names.

### Proxy

The add-on now supports proxymats.

<img src="_images/mat_dagormat_proxy.png" alt="Dagormat - Proxy" align="center">

Proxymat parameter information is taken from the `.blk` file, so all settings
for them are hidden. Instead, a new tab allows you to specify the path to the
proxymat directory. It can still be edited as text or temporarily unchecked as
**is proxymat**.

Changes can be reverted by reloading information from the file or saved to the
proxymat. Any regular material can also be converted to a proxymat by toggling
the checkbox and saving it to the desired directory.

```{note}
Proxymats in Blender use the file name, not a user-defined one. Upon import,
shaders are automatically renamed if the name differs.
```

```{seealso}
For more information, see
[Proxymats](../../../../assets/materials/proxymats.md).
```

## Object Properties

Located in the N-panel under the **Dagor** tab, it shows parameters of the
active object and is hidden if there is no active object.

<img src="_images/obj_prop.png" alt="Object Properties" align="center">

### Properties

Visual editing allows you to add or remove parameters individually and change
their values.

The UI format is determined by the `value` string. If the wrong UI option
appears (e.g., `prop:r=0` gives an integer toggle, while the variable should be
a float slider), enter the parameter name in the **name** field and the correct
format value (e.g., `0.0` instead of `0` for a float slider). Specify the type
in the name using `:`.

### Presets

Once properties are configured, you can save them as a preset for quick
application to other objects.

To save the active object's properties, enter a name for the preset and click
**Save preset as:**. To apply an existing preset, select it from the dropdown
and click **Apply preset:**.

Since presets are simple text files, you might want to edit them in a text
editor. The **open presets folder** button opens the directory containing all
presets in `.txt` format, where you can add, delete, or edit them. Changes are
applied immediately.

If presets folder is not found, this block is replaced by path parameter.
When existing path is entered, you still can return to editing it
by pressing **gears** button near the **open presets folder**.

### Tools

Editing in text format within Blender, similar to material editing, requires
opening the to the file specified in the tooltip by clicking **Open as text**.

**Apply...**: applies changes from the text.

**Write example**: writes an example to the text (without applying it, since
you will likely need to modify the example for your specific situation).

**Transfer Attr**: copies the properties from the active object to all selected
objects, saving time on manual copying.

Starting from `version 2.1.0`, the text object **props_temp** opens
automatically if the internal text editor is open.

```{note}
Incorrect values in **Object Properties** are recorded in a new **broken
properties** field; separated by `;`, allowing manual recovery. Similarly,
incorrect values when using **Apply from text** are recorded.
```

## Export

Like any other import-export add-on, the `.dag` exporter is available through
**File > Export**. However, to save time during multiple re-exports in the
workflow, the exporter is also available in the N-panel. The functionality is
identical, so choose the option that is most convenient for you.

### Batch Export

General parameters:

- **vNormals**: saves custom normals if they have been added to the object.
  Without custom normals, even with the checkbox active, the export will include
  smoothing groups.

- **applyMods**: exports geometry with visible modifiers applied.

- **Optimize Materials**: keeps only the materials used on at least one polygon
  for each object.

- **Path**: the path where the file will be saved.

- **Cleanup Names**: ignore indices (`.000+`) during export.

```{note}
Use **Cleanup...** only for exporting composite parts for 3ds Max. It can cause
issues. In a `.dag` file for the game engine, there should not be multiple
objects with the same name.
```

- **Name**: context-sensitive field, appearing only when exporting to a single
  `.dag` file. This field is hidden in other export modes.

- **Collection**: also context-sensitive field. You do not need to select a
  collection from the dropdown; you can simply drag the desired collection from
  the **Outliner**.

- **Limit by**: allows you to choose the export mode.

#### Examples

1. **Limit by:** Visible

   **Export object:** export all scene contents to `Path\<Name>.dag`.

   **Example input:**

   <img src="_images/batch_exp_visible.png" alt="Limit by - Visible" align="center">

   **Example output:** `C:\tmp\Filename.dag` contains all scene objects with
   custom normals.

2. **Limit by:** Sel.Joined

   **Export object:** export selected objects to `Path\<Name>.dag`.

   **Example input:**

   <img src="_images/batch_exp_sel_joined.png" alt="Limit by - Sel.Joined" align="center">

   **Example output:** `C:\tmp\Filename.dag` contains only selected scene objects.

3. **Limit by:** Sel.Separated

   **Export object:** export selected objects to separate `.dag` files, where
   the names of selected objects are used as file names.

   **Example input:**

   <img src="_images/batch_exp_sel_separated.png" alt="Limit by - Sel.Separated" align="center">

   **Example output:** `C:\tmp\cube.lod00.dag`, `C:\tmp\cube.lod01.dag`.

4. **Limit by:** Col.Separated

   **Export object:** export collections from the hierarchy starting from the
   selected one, if there are no subcollections inside. The **exportOrphans**
   checkbox allows exporting objects that lie next to subcollections.

   **Example input:**

   <img src="_images/batch_exp_col_separated.png" alt="Limit by - Col.Separated" align="center">

   **Example output:** `C:\tmp\cube.lod00.dag` contains visible geometry and
   occluder inside, `C:\tmp\cube.lod01.dag` contains visible geometry and
   collider inside and `C:\tmp\cube.lod02.dag`. `C:\tmp\cube_temp.dag` will not
   be exported, because the **exportOrphans** checkbox is not enabled. If you
   don't specify the collection at all, then in this case the result will be
   identical, because the check will start with **SceneCollection**, and it
   contains only the **cube** collection.

5. **Limit by:** Col.Joined

   **Export object:** export all contents of the selected collection to a file
   with the name of this collection. Created mainly for [Asset
   Viewer](../../../asset-viewer/asset-viewer/asset_viewer.md) of assets
   created from several `.dag` files.

   **Example input:**

   <img src="_images/batch_exp_col_joined.png" alt="Limit by - Col.Joined" align="center">

   **Example output:** `C:\tmp\soviet_town_building_5_floors_a_joined.lod00.dag`
   contains all null LODs (level of detail) related to this building. The
   collections have been linked (transfer with `Ctrl` in **Outliner**), i.e.
   they are not copies, but the same collections. The rest of the temporary LODs
   (Level of Detail) can be prepared in the same way. It's much faster than
   selecting objects and typing the name manually.

   ```{note}
   Since they are the same collections and not copies, do not delete them with
   `Del`, but remove them with `RMB` **> Unlink**, so that you don't overwrite
   them.
   ```

## Collection Properties

Located in the N-panel, similar to **Object Properties**. It shows properties of
the active collection. Unlike **Object Properties**, these properties exist only
within Blender and are used for internal purposes.

<img src="_images/coll_prop.png" alt="Collection Properties" align="center">

### Override Name

Allows you to override the name with which the collection will be exported to
**Col.Separated** mode. By default, overriding is disabled.

When importing `.dag` files with names longer than 63 characters (the Blender
limit), the name will be recorded in this field to preserve the "overflow"
characters. You can also manually rename it – enable the checkbox and enter the
new name:

<img src="_images/coll_prop_override_ex_1.png" alt="Override name" align="center">

In the given example, the contents of the collection will be exported to
`C:\tmp\cube.lod00.dag` instead of `C:\tmp\Collection.dag`. However, this is not
the most useful application.

A much more practical use is when you need to save multiple `.dag` files in
different subdirectories. Here, you can specify a subpath that will be appended
to the main export path. If there is no need to rename the collection, simply
end the subpath with `*`, which will be replaced by the collection name during
export:

<img src="_images/coll_prop_override_ex_2.png" alt="Override name" align="center">

In this example, the export path will be
`C:\tmp\subfolder\yet_another_subfolder\cube.lod00.dag`, which is convenient for
working with complex assets like buildings. For example, windows in
`composit_parts\windows\*`, doors in `composit_parts\doors\*`, and so on.

Additionally, you can completely override the path – start it with the drive
letter:

<img src="_images/coll_prop_override_ex_3.png" alt="Override name" align="center">

In this case, the **Path** field will be ignored for this collection, and the
file will be exported to `D:\daNetGame\develop\assets\rendinst_1lod\`.

#### Type

Used by the [Composite
Editor](../dag4blend-comp-editor/dag4blend_comp_editor.md). When importing, it
records the node type, and during export, it ensures a unique type (to avoid
double interpretation in the presence of asset namesakes, typically found among
composites and rendinsts). For manually created item intended for composite
export, set this manually.

<img src="_images/coll_prop_override_type.png" alt="Type" align="center">

Since it is used for composites, DynModel is in the list but not actually
applied – it can't be arranged through composites. Therefore, the composite
importer assumes all assets with `.lod**.dag` in their name are RendInsts, not
DynModels.

### Geometry Nodes

```{note}
Currently, geometry nodes cannot be combined with custom normals, as applying
the modifier erases them. If you're placing instances using geometry nodes,
don't forget to add the **Realize instances** node; otherwise, the geometry will
be lost during export. Technically, before this node, they are similar to
"empty" without their own geometry.
```

## Smoothing Groups

A bug was discovered in Blender's function for calculating smoothing groups for
formats that use them. To solve this, a smoothing group editor has been added.
It's available in *Edit* Mode when Face selection mode is active.

Upon import, objects retain smoothing groups from the original file. New
objects, however, do not have smoothing groups, so you must create them with the
**Init** button:

<img src="_images/sm_groups_1.png" alt="Smoothing groups" align="center">

When smoothing exist, the interface works similarly to 3ds Max, but without
real-time display. Partial preview is available via **Convert to Sharp Edges**,
which shows only sharp edges from the smoothing groups.

<img src="_images/sm_groups_2.png" alt="Smoothing groups" align="center">

Starting with `version 2.1.0`, the **Live Update** function recalculates hard
edges during smoothing group editing. This can slow down performance on heavy
geometry, so it is off by default.

From the same version, you can also select polygons by smoothing group. Click
the corresponding group button in the **Select by SG** subpanel.

```{note}
Selecting by smoothing group adds to the existing selection, rather than
replacing it. So, if you need to select only group 3, for example, clear the
selection first.
```

### When to Use?

If a model has areas where sharp edges do not fully divide the surface into
closed regions, the smoothing group calculation will be incorrect and needs
manual adjustment. You may also need to adjust smoothing groups after modifying
existing `.dag` file post-import if the groups were saved as an attribute.

<img src="_images/sm_groups_3.png" alt="Smoothing groups" align="center">

## Import

Similar to export, there are two methods for import – the standard method via
**File > Import** and the batch import via N-panel.

### Import and Textures

A `.dag` file contains not only the texture name but also its path. However,
these paths are often become invalid when files are transferred. If the texture
path os invalid or only the texture name is provided, it will be replaced with a
UV checker texture. If a texture is used in multiple materials, updating the
path in one will update it across all materials.

Most common used shaders have a dedicated nodegroups, that roughly mimic the in-game look.
All of this nodegroups are stored in `dag4blend\extras\library.blend` and being linked automatically.
Shaders without their own nodegroup are displayed as [rendinst_simple](../../../../assets/shaders/dng-shaders/rendinst_simple.md) without parameters.
Textures can be previewed from node-based *Shader Editor*, if **Node Wrangler** enabled.
Clicking `Shift`+`Ctrl`+`LMB` on texture shows it as simple unlit shader.

### File > Import

**Parameters:**

- **Optimize material slots**: removes unused slots and merges slots with the
  same material.

- **Import LODs**: imports all LODs, not just the selected `.dag` file.

- **Import dps**: imports all damage_parts (`_dp`).

- **Import dmgs**: imports all damage versions.

- **Replace existing**: if a collection with the asset name exists in the scene,
  it will replace its contents with those from the `.dag` file instead of
  creating a duplicate with a `.001+` suffix. Useful for quickly reverting
  multiple changes.

  <img src="_images/file_import.png" alt="File Import" align="center">

### Batch Import

For importing several assets at once, it's better to use the **Batch Import**
panel. This panel is much more functional than the basic import option. The
question icon {octicon}`question;1em` in the header enables an additional block
with a short description of the active import mode.

<img src="_images/batch_imp.png" alt="Batch Import" align="center">

The **Batch Import** panel has two main blocks: global parameters
([**Parameters**](#parameters)) and mode ([**Simple**](#simple-mode),
[**Wildcard**](#wildcard-mode), [**Regexp**](#regex-mode)).

#### Parameters

  It contains all the parameters for processing `.dag` regardless mode.

- **Search in subfolders**: checks all subdirectories for files. Use cautiously,
  as it can freeze Blender if too many matches are found.

- **Optimize material slots**: same as in regular import.

- **Preserve Smoothing Groups**: saves smoothing groups as an attribute to
  ensure they don't change during export. Not recommended if you plan to modify
  the geometry after import.

- **Reimport existing**: when checked, if corresponding collection for .dag found,
  importer replaces its content by newly imported data. When unchecked,
  it will import to the new collection with first unused index `.001+` available.

- **Preserve paths**: saves the full path to the `.dag` file (including the file
  name) in **Collection Property**. Useful when importing file from multiple
  directories and needing to export them back to original locations.

#### Simple Mode

This mode currently matches behavior of [**File > Import**](#file--import), 
but can search in subfolders for variations, if corresponding parameter is set to `True`.

If the filepath in the **File Path** field does not exist, the **IMPORT** button
will be disabled. If the parent directory of the filepath does not exist, the
**open import directory** button will also be disabled.

#### Wildcard Mode

<img src="_images/batch_imp_wildcard.png" alt="Batch Import Wildcard" align="center">

Instead of a single file path, this mode uses a directory path (**Dirpath**) and
a set of rules for processing files. It uses the
[fnmatch](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html) library for filtering.

Rules are quite simple:

```{eval-rst}
+------------+---------------------------------------------+
| Pattern    | Meaning                                     |
+============+=============================================+
| ``*``      | matches everything                          |
+------------+---------------------------------------------+
| ``?``      | matches any single character                |
+------------+---------------------------------------------+
| ``[seq]``  | matches any character in *seq*              |
+------------+---------------------------------------------+
| ``[!seq]`` | matches any character not in *seq*          |
+------------+---------------------------------------------+
```

Every other symbol is processed as is.

- **Includes**: set of masks for selecting `.dag` files. If name matches at least one of the includes, file would be imported.
  If filter has no simbols in it, it will be marked by `ERROR` icon and ignored on import.

- **Excludes**: same syntax as includes, but for excluding files from import.

```{note}
This mode works with exact match, so if even if filename contains include, it could be skipped.
Use `*` to mark places where additional characters could be.
The only exception is file extension. Each filter is compared to `filename.dag` and `filename`,
so you don't have to specify extension every time.
```

  **Example:**

**Includes:** `“asset_a.lod0[0,2]", "asset_b_dp*”;` **Excludes**: `“*_dmg*”`
imports `asset_a.lod00.dag`, `asset_a.lod02.dag`, and all LODs of all
`asset_b_dp`, except their `_dmg` versions. The `other_asset_a.lod00.dag` file
would be skipped, because `*` is not present in the beginning of include, so
extra symbols are not allowed.

#### Regex Mode

This mode is quite similar to previous one, but uses full power of [regular expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax).

It exist for rare cases, when fnmatch is not enough for some comlex processing.
If you're not familliar with regex synthax, just stick to **Wildcard** mode.

```{note}
When you paste a filepath from Explorer into the **File Path** field of the
**Simple** mode, quotation marks (`"`) are removed automatically.

When you paste a filepath into the **Dirpath** field of the **Wildcard** or
**Regex** modes, it's trimmed down to the directory path, while the filename is
moved to the includes section (with corrected syntax).
```

```{note}
Blender will be unresponsive until the import is complete. To monitor the
import process, open the console (**Window > Toggle system console**).
```

#### Additional Features

Often, you may need to import a single asset that is already open in [Asset
Viewer](../../../asset-viewer/asset-viewer/asset_viewer.md) or Explorer. Instead
of searching for it through **File > Import**, you can copy the path from [Asset
Viewer](../../../asset-viewer/asset-viewer/asset_viewer.md) or Explorer (`RMB`
**> Copy as path**) and paste it into **Path** field of the batch import panel.
This action will automatically transfer the file name to **Masks**, and clicking
**IMPORT** will load only the desired asset.

If you only have the asset's name, you can enter it in **Masks** and then use
the **Apply as search path** button to set the entire project directory with
subdirectories as the search path.

If the path is unknown, the import will be slower by a few seconds (due to
search file), but this is often faster than searching the full path manually.

<img src="_images/batch_imp_add_feat.png" alt="Batch Import Additional Features" align="center">

## Tools

The panel is continuously being improved. Tools are grouped into blocks that can
be collapsed when not in use to avoid cluttering the interface.

<img src="_images/tools.png" alt="Tools" align="left">

- **Optimize material slots**: merges identical material slots and removes
  unused ones.

- **Merge Duplicates**: merges identical materials with different indices (e.g.,
  `Material` and `Material.001`). These duplicate materials often arise when
  copying objects using `Ctrl`+`C` / `Ctrl`+`V`, as this operation saves the
  selection to an external `.blend` file and then appends it to the active scene
  along with all its materials.

- **Find missing textures**: searches the textures without valid paths in the
  selected project's directory.

- **Find missing proxymats**: similar functionality for proxymats.

- **Save textures**: collects all textures with valid paths from selected
  objects and saves them in the `/textures/` subdirectory of the export
  directory.

- **Preserve Sharp Edges**: marks sharp edges based on Autosmooth Angle, and
  sets the angle to 180&deg; to ensure consistency between the model in the
  scene and in the `.dag` file. This function is not mandatory before exporting,
  as it will automatically apply to the exported geometry (keeping the original
  scene geometry unchanged).

- **Apply Modifiers**: applies modifiers to the geometry. Not mandatory before
  export as the exporter can preserve modifiers in the original scene.

- **Clear normals**: removes custom normals from selected objects.

- **sort collections**: recursively groups scene collections by the longest
  matching name prefix. You can see the example on the screenshot for the
  [“Col.Joined” export](#batch-export).

- **pack orphans**: searches for objects not at the hierarchy's bottom and
  creates individual collections for them.

- **Setup Destruction**: assigns a list of typical object properties for
  destruction to all selected objects:

<br clear="left">

```text
  animated_node:b=yes
  physObj:b=yes
  collidable:b=no
  massType:t=none
```

Creates *bounding boxes* (BBoxes) objects with `gi_black` material, sets them as
children, and assigns collider parameters:

```text
  materialName:t=[value from the material field]
  density:r=[value from the density field]
  massType:t=box
  collType:t=box
```

The BBoxes may still need to be adjusted and scaled to better fit the
silhouette. In some cases, they may also need to be duplicated. However, this
process still saves time in the overall setup.

## Texture Baker

Allows baking textures from complex shaders to
[rendinst_simple](../../../../assets/shaders/dng-shaders/rendinst_simple.md).
Commonly used for final LODs or porting assets to mobile projects.

#### General Limitations of the Add-on Tools in Blender

- Limitation on the number of characters in the name – names longer than 63
  characters will be truncated, and when importing objects with the same name,
  an index `.001` is appended, reducing the maximum name length by 4 more
  characters. Starting from version `1.2.6`, overly long names are saved in
  **Collection Property**.

- Animations are not supported yet.
