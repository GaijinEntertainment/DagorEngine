# About Dagor

The Dagor Engine is an open-source game engine by
[Gaijin](https://gaijinent.com/), continuously updated since 2002 for
high-performance gaming and realistic graphics.

## Platform Support

Supports Windows PC, Linux, iOS, Android, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4,
PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S.

## Games Created with Dagor Engine

Powers games with detailed physics and large-scale environments, including:

- [**War Thunder**](https://warthunder.com/): vehicular combat game with air,
  land, and sea battles across historical eras.
- [**Enlisted**](https://enlisted.net/): squad-based WWII first-person shooter
  with large-scale battles.
- [**War Thunder Mobile**](https://www.wtmobile.com/): mobile adaptation of War
  Thunder for iOS and Android.

## Key Features

- **Graphics Engine**: supports DirectX 12, Vulkan, and Metal APIs.

- **Physics Engine**: Dagor supports third party open source industry standard
solutions for physics simulation: [Jolt
Physics](https://github.com/jrouwe/JoltPhysics) (preferable) and [Bullet
Physics](https://github.com/bulletphysics).

- **daGI (Dagor Global Illumination)**

  - Optimized for efficient global illumination on huge dynamic scenes with low
    memory usage (less than 1ms on PS4!), and with raytracing support for modern
    hardware.
  - Simulates indirect lighting and light bouncing for realistic scenes:

  - Directed acyclic graph for defining frame rendering sequences.
  - Allows flexible integration of game-specific and engine features.

- **daNetGame Framework**

  - Modular platform for comprehensive game development.
  - Integrates core systems like rendering, physics, networking, and audio.

- **[Daslang](https://daslang.io/)**

  - Scripting language for interacting with core systems like rendering and
    physics.
  - Enables dynamic content management and engine functionality extension.

- **[DSHL (Dagor Shader Language)](../api-references/dagor-dshl/index.rst)**

  - Specialized language for shader creation and management.
  - Supports advanced features like conditionals, custom data types, and
    hardware-specific optimizations.

- [**Toolset**](../dagor-tools/index.rst)

  - [daEditor](../dagor-tools/daeditor/daeditor/daeditor.md): level editor with
    terrain editing, prefab placement, and plugin support.
  - [Asset Viewer](../dagor-tools/asset-viewer/asset-viewer/asset_viewer.md):
    resource editor and viewer for special effects, particle systems, and
    animations.
  - [Impostor Baker](../dagor-tools/impostor-baker/impostor_baker.md): tool for
    optimizing rendering with simplified 3D object representations.
  - [Importers and Exporters](../dagor-tools/addons/index.rst): integration with
    3ds Max, Maya, and Blender.

- **Networking Subsystem**

  - Scalable, low-latency architecture for multiplayer games.
  - Supports TCP and UDP protocols, with built-in tools for debugging, lag
    compensation, and data compression.

- **Audio Engine**

  - Uses FMOD library for 3D sound, DSP effects, and multi-channel support.

- **Animation System**

  - Supports skeletal and procedural animation, blending, morphing, and various
    controllers, including Inverse Kinematics, additive animations and motion
    matching.
