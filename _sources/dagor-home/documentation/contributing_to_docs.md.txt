# Contributing to Documentation

If you would like to contribute to the Dagor Engine documentation, follow the
steps outlined below:

1. **Fork the Repository**

   Fork the [Dagor Engine
   repository](https://github.com/GaijinEntertainment/DagorEngine) on GitHub and
   create a new branch specifically for your documentation updates.

2. **Make Your Changes**

   Edit or add documentation content as needed. Ensure that your changes are
   accurate and improve the clarity or completeness of the documentation.

3. **Build Locally**

   [Run a local build](how_to_build_docs_locally.md) of the documentation to
   verify that your changes render correctly. This helps catch any formatting or
   structural issues before submission.

4. **Adhere to Style Guidelines**

   Ensure that your modifications conform to [Dagor Documentation Style
   Guide](dagor_documentation_style_guide.md). Consistency in tone, formatting,
   and structure is essential for maintaining high-quality documentation.

5. **Commit and Submit**

   Commit your changes with clear and descriptive commit messages. Once you are
   satisfied with your updates, open a pull request on the original Dagor Engine
   repository for review.

By following these steps, you help maintain the quality and accuracy of the
Dagor Engine documentation, benefiting the entire development community.
