# Flickering Lights

## General Workflow

A flickering light source object is composed of several components.

<table style="style=text-align:left; width=98%"><thead>
  <tr style="border-bottom: 2px solid #ddd">
    <th style="text-align:center"><p>Object Type</p></th>

    <th style="text-align:center"><p>Description</p></th></tr></thead>

  <tr style="border-bottom: 2px solid #ddd">
    <td style="padding-top: 10px"><b>Base RendInst</b></td>
    <td style="padding-left: 15px; padding-top: 10px">industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a.lod**.dag</td>
    <td style="padding-left: 15px; padding-top: 10px">This is the model used as
    the base for creating a flickering lamp. In some cases, it may not be
    required, especially if you are designing a lamp from scratch with built-in
    flickering functionality.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr style="border-bottom: 2px solid #ddd">

    <td style="padding-left: 15px; padding-top: 10px">A detached part of the
    object without any emissive properties, exported as a separate render
    instance.

   This is necessary for:

   - Casting shadows (render instance shadows are significantly computationally
   cheaper than dynamic models shadows).
   - Destroying the light source (lights disappear when the render instance
   whose bounding box contains the centers of the light sources is destroyed).
   - Visually destroying the object (render instances are easily destroyed via
   destructors. Dealing with dynamic models is more complex, so we make them
   disappear following the light source rules – their pivots must fall within
   the bounding box of the destroyed render instance).

   Simply put, when the render instance is destroyed, the dynamic model
   disappears, the light source is removed, and the render instance breaks apart
   via the destructor.</td>

```

## Working with Geometry

For flickering light sources, the visual model must be divided into two parts:
the **Render Instance** and the **Dynamic Model**. The reasons for this have
already been outlined:

- **Shadow Casting**:

  Shadow casting for light sources from static models and dynamic models is
  enabled separately in the [light source template](./lights.md). While shadows
  from static objects impact performance, the effect is not as significant.
  However, shadows from dynamic models are very computationally expensive. That
  is the reason why they are rarely used. If the entire light fixture is made
  into a dynamic model, the light source inside it will not cast a shadow on the
  fixture.

- **Destruction**:

  The render instance is replaced with a destructible version when destroyed.
  This is a straightforward mechanism. In contrast, substituting the entire lamp
  dynamic model with a broken version involves a new, more complex pipeline,
  which isn't practical. Therefore, we destroy the dynamic model alongside the
  render instance. In this case, the dynamic model simply disappears, and the
  destroyed render instance is replaced with a damaged version of the dynamic
  model’s section, broken as necessary.

```{important}
If you're creating rare lamps that will be placed in around 10 locations on the
map and need to always flicker, follow the pipeline outlined in this article.

If you're creating lamps that will be used extensively across the map, with only
a few needing to flicker, follow this approach:

- Create a standard render instance with emissive properties for the majority of
  placements.
- Separately, create the flickering lamps using the current pipeline.

For example, for the current lamp, you'll have two distinct objects:

- `industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a_on.lod**.dag` – a render instance of the
  constantly illuminated lamp.
- `industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a_flicker_8m_cmp.composit.blk` – a composite file
  for the flickering lamp.
```

The example used here is the lamp `industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a`:

![industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a](./_images/industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a.jpg)

### RendInst + DynModel (Geometry Splitting)

A practical splitting between the render instance and the dynamic model is as
follows:

- **Dynamic Model**: Contains the bulb and part of the lamp that uses a lightmap
  with an emissive intensity mask in the alpha channel of the texture.
- **Render Instance**: Includes everything non-emissive and elements that cast
  interesting shadows, such as the protective bulb net. While the protective net
  could be part of the dynamic model (since it is illuminated), this would
  result in flat, uninteresting shadows. The net adds variation and depth to the
  shadow.

<img src="_images/industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a_01.jpg" width="49%" class="bg-primary">
<img src="_images/industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a_02.jpg" width="49%" class="bg-primary">

```{important}
To prevent de-synchronization between the matrices of the dynamic model and the
render instance, their pivots must align (positioned correctly in the scene
before exporting to `.dag` files). In the image above, they are shown side by
side for demonstration purposes only.
```

### Naming of Exported Objects

For an object initially named `industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a.lod**.dag`, the
split render instance and dynamic model should be named as follows:

- **RendInst**: `industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a_base.lod**.dag` – the non-emissive
  base, to which the rest is added.
- **Dynamic Model**: `industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a_flicker_dynmodel.lod**.dag` –
  the flickering dynamic model.

### Shaders

- **RendInst**: Uses standard shaders based on the asset creation technology.
- **Dynamic Model**: Uses a dynamic emissive shader, typically the
  [dynamic_emissive](../shaders/dng-shaders/rendinst_emissive.md) shader.

### Destructions

As mentioned earlier, destruction is only applied to render instances. Since
destroying dynamic models is more complex, both the dynamic models and light
sources will simply vanish when the associated render instance is destroyed, as
long as they are within its bounding box.

```{important}
"Automatic" destruction of lights and dynamic models will only occur under the
following conditions:
1. Their pivots must be inside the bounding box of the destroyed render
   instance. If they merely touch the edge, destruction will not occur.
2. The property `destroyable_with_rendinst:tag{}` must be specified in their
   templates. Most lights (99%) inherit this property from their base templates,
   so it typically doesn’t need to be added manually. However, for each new
   dynamic model, you must include this property in the template, such as in
   `industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a_flicker_8m_mesh`.
```

To properly configure destruction, you only need to:

1. Create a standard `_destr` for the render instance.
2. Define the render instance destruction in `rendinst_dmg.blk` according to
   standard guidelines.

```{important}
When destroying the render instance, the entire model must be affected, meaning
the destruction process must cover both the static and dynamic parts. Otherwise,
the dynamic model will disappear abruptly, leaving gaps in the remaining render
instance's geometry.
```

Here’s the proper destruction process:

  <th style="text-align:center; width:24%"><p>Render Instance</p></th>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:24%"><p>Dynamic Model</p></th>

  <th style="text-align:center; width:24%"><p>Render Instance Dynamic Model Destruction DMG(optional)</p></th></tr></thead>
</table>

<img src="_images/industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a_06.jpg" width="24%" class="bg-primary">

## Working with Textures and Materials

Some key considerations:

- The emissive mask, which is stored in the alpha channel of the albedo texture
  based on the
  [rendinst_emissive/dynamic_emissive](../shaders/dng-shaders/rendinst_emissive.md)
  shader system, should only be baked for the part of the model included in the
  dynamic model. Flickering is not supported for the render instance.

- Therefore, the render instance should not use an emissive shader unless
  specifically required by the artistic design (e.g., in a sci-fi setting).

- Keep in mind that the flickering light source does not account for the light
  color or the emissive color in the material. You must manually adjust the
  emissive color to match the desired light color (or vice versa if you're
  creating a new light). There is no automatic synchronization between them.

- Unless required by the artistic design, avoid baking colored light into the
  albedo texture. Doing so will restrict the emissive color options for the
  model (if someone else wishes to use it with a different color). The color and
  intensity of the emissive effect are controlled in the
  [rendinst_emissive/dynamic_emissive](../shaders/dng-shaders/rendinst_emissive.md)
  shader settings.

- As a result, if you need two identical lamps with different emission colors
  (e.g., white and red), you must create two separate dynamic models with
  different emissive material settings. This won’t be possible if the emissive
  color is baked into the albedo.

- Be aware that the [*Asset
  Viewer*](../../dagor-tools/asset-viewer/asset-viewer/asset_viewer.md) does not
  accurately display emissive color and intensity. All testing should be done
  in-game. Do not rely on the *Asset Viewer* for accurate results.

## Configuring the .folder.blk

If you’re unsure how the system handles `.dag` files and distinguishes between
dynamic models and render instances, please refer to the following
documentation:

- [.blk](../../dagor-tools/blk/blk.md)
- [.folder.blk](../all-about-blk/folder_blk.md)
- [Assets Philosophy](../about-assets/about_assets.md)

### Static Geometry Processing

As usual, follow the standard procedure for processing static geometry. The only
thing to note is that if you're handling static geometry at the beginning of the
`.folder.blk`, make sure to **exclude dynamic models**. Failing to do so will
cause them to be processed incorrectly.

**Example:**

```
virtual_res_blk{
  find:t="^(.*)\.lod00\.dag$"
  exclude:t = "_destr\.lod00\.dag$"
  exclude:t = "_dynmodel\.lod00\.dag$"
  className:t="rendInst"
  contents{
    lod{range:r=12;}
    lod{range:r=30;}
    lod{range:r=80;}
    allowProxyMat:b=yes
  }
}
```

If you process dynamic models first, no exclusion is needed later (since a
resource processed twice will not be handled again). Just remember to remove
unnecessary `stopProcessing:b=false` flags.

### Dynamic Geometry Processing

In Dagor Engine’s logic, a dynamic model is considered a dynamic model if:

1. It uses dynamic shaders.
2. It has a skeleton.

We’ve already assigned dynamic shaders in the materials, so now we need to
create the skeleton:

```
virtual_res_blk{                          // Skeleton creation block
  find:t="^((.*)_dynmodel)\.lod00\.dag$"  // Find all LOD00s with the _dynmodel postfix
  stopProcessing:b=false                  // Allows reprocessing of these .dag files in the next block

  className:t="skeleton"                  // Treat the found assets as skeletons (extracting data to build a skeleton asset)
  name:t="$2_skeleton"                    // Name the skeleton using the dynamic model name ($2) with a _skeleton postfix
  contents{                               // Additional data processing rules
    addSkinNodes:b=yes
    reduceNodes:b=yes
  }
}

virtual_res_blk{                          // Dynamic model creation block
  find:t="^((.*)_dynmodel)\.lod00\.dag$"  // Find all LOD00s with the _dynmodel postfix (due to the previous block's stopProcessing:b=false)
  stopProcessing:b=false                  // Likely a redundant parameter here.
  className:t="DynModel"                  // Process the found assets as dynamic models (extracting data to build the dynamic model asset)
  name:t="$2_dynmodel"                    // Name the dynamic model as $2_dynmodel (i.e., dynamic model name with _dynmodel postfix)
  contents{                               // Additional data processing rules
    lod{range:r=12;}                      // LOD distances
    lod{range:r=30;}
    lod{range:r=80;}
    ref_skeleton:t="$2_skeleton"          // Reference the skeleton created in the previous block
  }
}
```

```{important}
There may be some confusion regarding the naming of assets. We process objects
with the `_dynmodel` postfix, then assign two additional postfixes in the
skeleton and dynamic model creation blocks:

- `_skeleton`
- `_dynmodel`

This might lead to an expectation of names like:

- `_dynmodel_skeleton`
- `_dynmodel_dynmodel`

However, the *Asset Viewer* shows correct names without the redundant
`_dynmodel`.

![Important: Naming Considerations](./_images/industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a_07.jpg)

This is due to the search query defined in the
`find:t="^((.*)_dynmodel)\.lod00\.dag$"` statement.

Had the query been `find:t="^(.*_dynmodel)\.lod00\.dag$"`, the entire dynamic
model name, including `_dynmodel`, would be treated as the object name ($2). The
query we use ensures that only the inner-most group (i.e., the core object name
without `_dynmodel`) is treated as the object name.
```

### Collision Processing

As we know, collisions are now processed through file includes like `include
"#/develop/assets/_ri_collision_lod1.blk"`. By default, this include will also
affect dynamic models, as it doesn't exclude them. A logical approach would be
to first include the dynamic model collision block, but dynamic models don’t
handle collisions the same way – they are processed through damage models (DMs).

Thus, a hybrid processing solution is needed:

```
include "#/develop/assets/_ri_collision_lod1.blk"                                      // Include RenderInst collision processing.
"@override-last"{                                                                      // Override parameters from the included file.
  "@override:find":t="^(.*)_dynmodel\.lod01\.dag$"                                     // Find LOD01s specifically for dynamic models.
  "@override:contents"{gameResPack:t="game_logic.grp"; defCollidable:b=no;}         // Set assembly parameters for dynamic model collisions.
  stopProcessing:b=no                                                                  // Likely a redundant parameter here.
}

include "#/develop/assets/_ri_collision_lod1.blk"                                      // Repeat the RenderInst collision processing include.
```

This hybrid approach ensures that both the render instances and dynamic models
are handled appropriately within the collision pipeline.

### AnimChar

Technically, we cannot directly place a dynamic model on the map or use it
within the flicker templates we need. However, we can achieve this with an
animChar (animated character). Despite the abstract name, it allows us to manage
dynamic resources effectively.

In essence, the animChar file lists the dynamic resources that should be applied
to a specific animated model (flickering light is simply another form of
animation).

For instance, the `industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a_flicker_char.animChar.blk`
contains the following two lines:

```
dynModel:t="industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a_flicker_dynmodel"  // Dynamic model
skeleton:t="industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a_flicker_skeleton"  // Associated skeleton
```

Place the animChar file alongside the dynamic model, naming it after the model
with the suffix `_char.animChar.blk`. No additional `.folder.blk` processing is
required.

### GameObjects

[*Game Objects*](../about-assets/gameobjects/gameobjects.md) are essentially
placeholders, containers, or dummies with the same name as the related template.
They are used to position objects in the environment or to add them to template
composites. GameObjects provide the matrix information needed to trigger effects
like sound (SFX), visual effects (VFX), game triggers, and light sources.

Typically, GameObjects are stored in a common directory with other GameObjects.
In *daNetGame-based* projects, for example, this would be located at:

`/<project_name>/develop/assets/common/gameRes/gameObjects/`

We need the following:

1. `industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a_flicker_8m_light.gameObj.blk` – This GameObject
   represents the flickering light source (with an 8-meter radius) and will be
   placed on the map as a light source. Inside the `.blk` file, define:

   ```
   volumeType:t="point"
   ```

2. `industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a_flicker_8m_mesh.gameObj.blk` – This GameObject
   represents the flickering dynamic model and will be placed on the map as the
   dynamic object. Inside the `.blk` file, define:

   ```
   volumeType:t="point"
   ref_dynmodel:t="industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a_flicker_dynmodel"
   ```

   ```{important}
   Make sure to reference the correct dynamic model; otherwise, incorrect
   resources may be loaded.
   ```

### Composite Object

To place everything on the map, you’ll need to create a composite object, which
will include:
- The base render instance
- The flickering light game object
- The flickering dynamic model game object

Don’t forget to adjust the orientation of the light source based on the lamp’s
configuration (usually, lights are directed sideways along the X-axis).
Additionally, for optimal visuals, make use of [photometric light
sources](./photometric_lights.md) in *daNetGame*-based projects.

An example composite file for the flickering lamp:

```
className:t="composit"

node{
  name:t="industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a_base:rendInst"
  tm:m=[[1, 0, 0] [0, 1, 0] [0, 0, 1] [0, 0, 0]]
}

node{
  name:t="industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a_flicker_8m_mesh:gameObj"
  tm:m=[[1, 0, 0] [0, 1, 0] [0, 0, 1] [0, 0, 0]]
}

node{
  name:t="industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a_flicker_8m_light:gameObj"
  tm:m=[[0.961074, 0.27629, 0] [-2.08593e-08, 7.25591e-08, 1] [0.27629, -0.961074, 7.54979e-08] [0.624191, -0.270539, 0.0204315]]
}
```

### Light and Flicker Templates

Flicker sources are defined by templates, similar to light source templates, and
are stored in the `lights.blk` file within the `<project_name>/prog` directory. For
example:

`<project_name>/prog/gameBase/content/common/gamedata/templates/lights.blk`

These templates usually extend from or use base templates found in
`light_flicker.blk`, which is located in the "global" `prog` directory:

`/prog/daNetGameLibs/light_flicker/templates/light_flicker.blk`

These templates define the flickering behavior for light sources and/or emissive
intensity for dynamic models using
[rendinst_emissive/dynamic_emissive](../shaders/dng-shaders/rendinst_emissive.md)
shaders.

In general, three templates cover 99% of the cases, and they follow a specific
order. Using our current lamp as an example:

1. `industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a_flicker_8m_template` – Flicker template that
   defines flicker parameters (frequency, pauses, emissive intensity, etc.).
2. `industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a_flicker_8m_light` – Flickering light template,
   which links a light source (either an existing one or a custom one) to the
   flicker behavior defined above.
3. `industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a_flicker_8m_mesh` – Flickering lamp template,
   which links the flicker template to the dynamic model via the animChar.

The relationship between these templates is as follows:

- The flicker template links to:
  - The flickering light template.
  - The flickering dynamic model template.

You don’t always need to create new templates from scratch. If you have an
appropriate flicker template, you can reuse it by linking it to the required
light and dynamic model. However, the flickering lamp template (for the dynamic
model) will need to be recreated each time, as it uses specific animChars.

The flicker and flickering light templates can be reused in various combinations
and scenarios.

```{caution}
All templates are named after the lamps they are created for. Reusing templates
is possible, but this naming scheme can lead to confusion. It's up to you to
decide whether to recreate all templates from scratch or reuse existing ones
(though they may be named after other objects).
```

### Flicker Template

```{important}
The randomization settings for flickering will apply synchronously to all
identical lamps. This means that if you place two identical lamps next to each
other, they will flicker randomly but in sync! Each lamp can look very artistic,
but the sync flickering may not be desirable almost in all cases.

If you need to place multiple identical flickering lamps in close proximity,
create several flicker templates (and corresponding templates) along with
multiple composites, then place them randomly.
```

Let’s review the flicker template for the current lamp
(`<project_name>/prog/gameBase/content/common/gamedata/templates/lights.blk`):

```
industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a_flicker_8m_template{
  _use:t="light_flicker_with_sparks"

```

This template extends the root template `_use:t="light_flicker_with_sparks"`,
which contains additional parameters, including settings for sparks (covered in
the [VFX](./flickering_lights.md#vfx) section).

The key thing to understand about flicker parameter configuration is that each
parameter has a minimum and maximum value, and a random value between the two is
selected for each cycle. This allows you to create both uniform and highly
random flickering patterns.

Overall, the flicker effect is described by the following parameters, which
we’ll explore in detail below.

![Flicker Template](./_images/industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a_08.jpg)

### Cycle Elements

- `light_flicker__attack_time:p2 = 0.01, 0.15`: Time required for the light
    source to transition from the "off" to "on" state. The time, in seconds, for
    the light source to ignite. With these parameters, each new cycle will take
    between `0.01` and `0.15` seconds.

- `light_flicker__on_time:p2 = 0.01, 0.5`: Duration of the "on" state. The time,
    in seconds, the light source will remain lit.

- `light_flicker__release_time:p2 = 0.25, 0.75`: Time required for the light
    source to transition from the "on" to "off" state. The time, in seconds, for
    the light source to fade out.

- `light_flicker__off_time:p2 = 0.01, 4`: Duration of the "off" state. The time,
    in seconds, the light source will remain off.

### Brightness Control

- `light_flicker__on_brightness:p2 = 0.6, 1.0`: Brightness multiplier during
    the "on" state. Multiplies the brightness of the base light source or
    emissive shader when the light is on.

- `light_flicker__off_brightness:p2 = 0.0, 0.1`: Brightness multiplier during
    the "off" state. Multiplies the brightness of the base light source or
    emissive shader when the light is off.

### Additional Micro-Noise

- `light_flicker__noise_brightness_on:p2=0.25,1.0`: Multiplier for low/high
    noise amplitude when the light is "on". Multiplies the micro-flickering
    effect during the "on" state, based on the `light_flicker__on_brightness`.

- `light_flicker__noise_brightness_off:p2=0.0,1.0`: Multiplier for low/high
    noise amplitude when the light is "off". Multiplies the micro-flickering
    effect during the "off" state, based on the `light_flicker__off_brightness`.

- `light_flicker__noise_time:r=50.0`: Noise frequency (per second). The
    frequency of micro-flickering. This value is deterministic and does not
    involve randomness.

### VFX

We can choose from various base templates, which are extended in our
implementation. Examples include:

- `_use:t="light_flicker"`: Basic template without additional effects.
- `_use:t="light_flicker_with_sparks"`: Adds sparks and sound effects, suitable
  for indoor lamps.
- `_use:t="light_flicker_with_sparks_nightly"`: Adds sparks and sound effects
  only during nighttime, which is appropriate for outdoor lights.

The sparks will appear as shown below:

![VFX](./_images/industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a_09.jpg)

The chance of sparks appearing can be overridden using the parameter
`light_flicker__sparksEffectSpawnChance:r=0.3`.

Other settings are embedded in the base template `light_flicker.blk` in the
global program. By default, the `envir_sparks_burst_tiny_smoke` VFX is used, but
future updates will allow customization of the VFX.

### Flickering Light Template (Light Source)

As an example, consider `industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a_flicker_8m_light`:

```
industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a_flicker_8m_light{
  _use:t="spot_light_little_b"
  _use:t="light_flicker_updater_light"
  light_flicker_updater__template:t="industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a_flicker_8m_template"
}
```

This template includes:

- `_use:t="spot_light_little_b"`: Inherits the light source. However, you can
  override the light source parameters as needed. For example:

    ```
    light__max_radius:r=7
    light__color:c=208, 191, 152, 255
    light__brightness:r=121
    light__nightly:b=no
    ```

- `_use:t="light_flicker_updater_light": A required parameter for flickering
  light source templates. Synchronizes the flickering effect.

- `light_flicker_updater__template:t="industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a_flicker_8m_template"`:
  Points to our flickering settings template from the previous section.

```{important}
Regarding `_use:t="spot_light_little_b"`

It’s recommended to create a unique light source for each new lamp. This
approach eliminates the need for overrides within the template. Layering
extended light sources on top of each other can create issues when trying to
modify the settings of a specific light source. You would need to ensure that no
other light source is extending it.

Alternatively, instead of extending a light source, you could define it entirely
within the current template. However, in this case, the light source would
always be tied to the flickering template. Typically, flickering light sources
are used to add variation to non-flickering lights. For example, in a hallway
with several identical lamps, only some of them flicker. It makes sense to use a
single reference light source for both variants.
```

### Flickering Dynamic Model Template

For example, consider `industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a_flicker_8m_mesh`:

```
industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a_flicker_8m_mesh{
  _use:t="light_flicker_updater_mesh"
  animchar__res:t="industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a_flicker_char"
  light_flicker_updater__template:t="industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a_flicker_8m_template"
  "destroyable_with_rendinst:tag" {}
}
```

This template includes:

- `_use:t="light_flicker_updater_mesh"`: A required parameter for flickering
  dynamic model templates. Synchronizes the flickering effect.

- `animchar__res:t="industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a_flicker_char"`: Specifies the
  animation character for our model. This effectively transmits the flickering
  effect to the dynamic model.

- `light_flicker_updater__template:t="industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a_flicker_8m_template"`:
  Points to our flickering settings template.

- `"destroyable_with_rendinst:tag" {}`: Specifies that the dynamic model should
  disappear if its pivot intersects with the bounding box of a destroyed render
  instance.

```{note}
All emissive settings of the dynamic model (except for color, likely) will be
overridden by the parameters from the flickering template
(`industrial_lamp_steel_wall_a_flicker_8m_template`).
```
