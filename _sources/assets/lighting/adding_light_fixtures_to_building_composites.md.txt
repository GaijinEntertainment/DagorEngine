# Adding Light Fixtures to Building Composites

## Overview

This article explains how to add light fixtures to existing building composites,
using the *Enlisted* project as an example. However, the process is generally
applicable to any *daNetGame*-based projects.

## Preparing Workspace

For efficient and streamlined work with large composites, you will need to open
three [*Asset
Viewer*](../../dagor-tools/asset-viewer/asset-viewer/asset_viewer.md) windows
and one [*daEditor*](../../dagor-tools/daeditor/daeditor/daeditor.md) window.

1. Open *daEditor* and select the desired map. In this example, it’s the *Battle
   of Berlin*.
2. Locate the building composite you want to modify and copy its name. For this
   guide, we will use *goebbels_villa* as the example.
3. In the first *Asset Viewer* window, find the composite of the selected
   building.
4. In the second *Asset Viewer* window, open the composite that contains the
   light fixtures or the one where the lights will be placed.
5. In the third *Asset Viewer* window, open the specific light fixture that will
   be added to the composite.

Your workspace should look something like this:

## Adding Light Fixture

The easiest way to add your light fixture is by replacing an existing object
within the composite. While not the only method, this approach is currently the
fastest, requiring minimal steps. Importantly, it preserves the original
composite’s pivot points and avoids the need for manual edits in a text editor.

1. Select any convenient object within the composite and duplicate it by
   dragging the pivot arrows while holding down `Shift`. In the pop-up window,
   click **OK**.

2. In the *Outliner* window, select the duplicated asset, right-click on it, and
   choose **Change asset**.

3. In the pop-up window, type the name of the required light fixture in the
   `Filter` field (e.g., `is_chandelier_h_tall_double_on_cmp`). In the *ALL*
   tab, navigate to the directory where the light fixture is located. Then,
   select the asset from the list in the lower window and click **Select
   asset**. This will replace the existing object with the desired light
   fixture.

4. Adjust the position of the light fixture as needed, then save the composite.
5. After saving, check the changes in the parent composite using the first
   *Asset Viewer* window and the *daEditor* window.
6. If any adjustments are needed, make the necessary changes in the appropriate
   window, save again, and verify the updates in other windows.

### Exporting the Map

If everything looks correct, export the map from *daEditor* by navigating to
**Project > Export to Game (PC Format)**. In the following windows, click **OK**
without changing any settings. When prompted, overwrite the existing map by
clicking **OK** in the dialog box.

Finally, launch the game and check for any bugs or issues.
