# Physmats

## Placement and Configuration

**Physmats** (short for *physical materials*) define the physical properties of
surfaces and objects the player interacts with, such as terrain, environmental
assets, or destructible objects. These interactions include driving over,
colliding with, shooting at, or destroying the materials.

The physical material configuration defines the following properties:

- **Passability**: Specifies whether a surface or object can be traversed.
- **Interaction Effects**: Determines the visual, audio, or gameplay effects
  triggered during player interaction.
- **Vehicle Behavior**: Defines how each material type influences vehicle
  handling and response.

The physmat configuration file is located at:
`<project_name>/develop/gameBase/config/physmat.blk`

### File Structure

The general structure of the physmat configuration file is as follows:


```blk
PhysMats{          // Container block for all physical materials
  __DefaultParams{ // Default parameters applied to all physmats unless explicitly overridden
    a
    b
    ...
  }
  physmat1{}       // Individual physmat definition with its specific parameters
  physmat2{}
  ...
  physmatN{}
}

InteractPropsList{     // Configuration block for player interactions with physical materials
  visibilityCamera{    // Defines physmats that do not collide with the camera
    transparentCamera{ // A physmat excluded from camera collision
      en:b= no         // 'no' disables collision with the camera
    }
  }
  visibilityRay{      // Defines physmats that are transparent for ray tracing
                      // For example, through which tank markers should remain visible.
    transparentBeton{ // A physmat through which tank markers remain visible
      en:b= no        // 'no' disables collision with the tracing ray
    }
  }
  tankTrack{          // Defines physmats that interact with tank tracks
                      // All driveable physmats must be listed here
    default{          // Physmat entry
      fk:r= 1.0       /* Friction coefficient multiplier; 1.0 is standard, values < 1 simulate slippery surfaces,
                         e.g., setting '0.5' simulates ice. */
      rollingFrictionK:r= 0.045   /* Rolling friction coefficient; lower values reduce rolling resistance
                                     Hard surfaces typically have lower values than soft ones */
    }
  }
  wheel{              /* Defines physmats that interact with vehicle wheels
                         All driveable physmats must be listed here */
    default{          // Physmat entry
      fk:r= 1.0       /  Friction coefficient multiplier; 1.0 is standard, values < 1 simulate slippery surfaces,
                         e.g., setting '0.5' simulates ice. */
      rollingFrictionK:r= 0.03   /* Rolling friction coefficient; lower values reduce rolling resistance
                                    Hard surfaces typically have lower values than soft ones */
    }
  }
}
```

### Physmat Parameters

The following parameters are currently supported in physmat definitions. These
are demonstrated using an example physmat named `horse{}`, which includes all
known configurable properties:

`horse{}`
: Name of the physical material. Must be unique within the configuration.

`bf_class:t = "horse_class"`
: Material class identifier. This acts as a tag used to reference the physmat in
  the `InteractPropsList{}` block.

`color:c = 255,162,0,100`
: Debug render color in RGBA format. Typically used for visual debugging. Usage
  is currently uncommon.

`isWater:b = 0`
: Specifies whether the material represents water. A value of `1` marks it as
  water.

`isUnit:b = 1`
: Indicates whether the material represents a unit (e.g., a vehicle or
  character).

#### Aircraft-Specific Parameters

`shakeMultiplier:r = 1`
: Multiplier affecting screen shake when aircraft interact with this material.

`frictionMultiplier:r = 1`
: Friction multiplier applied to aircraft interactions.

#### Tank-Specific Parameters

`dustFactor:r = 0.14`
: Controls the amount of dust that accumulates on tanks from this material.

`mudFactor:r = 0.1`
: Controls the amount of mud that accumulates on tanks.

`deformable_width:r = 0.05`
: Defines the deformation depth of terrain under tank tracks.

`tankTracksTexId:i = 0`
: Likely specifies the texture ID used for track marks left by tanks.

`resistanceK:r = 0.00035`
: Friction coefficient for tank movement over this material.

`trackEffectsPreset:t = "soil"`
: References a named preset from the `trackEffectsPresets{}` block in
  `gameParams.blk`. Defines the visual and audio effects triggered when a tank
  drives over this material.

`trackDirtSpawnRateMult:r = 1.2`
: Multiplier that controls the rate of dirt or particle effects generated by
  tank tracks on this material.

#### Explosion and Impact Parameters

```{important}
The `explosionPatch{}` block is interchangeable with the `explMat` parameter.
Only one of these should be specified per physmat. Specifying both is
unsupported. If neither is defined, the client may crash. Details below.
```

##### Explosion Patch Parameters

These parameters define the visual and physical behavior of bomb or rocket
explosions (typically from aircraft). When used, they replace the need for
`explMat`.

`explosionPatchShader:t = "explosion_patch"`
: Presumed to define the decal shader for explosion effects. May involve both
  normal and diffuse maps. SDK did not reveal its effect.

`explosionPatchTexture:t = "explosion_patch_rocks_n"`
: Likely defines the normal map texture used for explosion decals.
  SDK did not reveal its effect.*

`explosionPatchTexcoord:p4 = 0, 0, 1, 1`
: Presumably sets the texture atlas coordinates used for explosion decals.
  SDK did not reveal its effect.

`explosionPatchHeightScale:r = 0.01`
: Likely controls the heightmap deformation scale applied to explosion decals.
  SDK did not reveal its effect.

##### Alternative Explosion Material

`explMat:t = "default"`
: References an explosion material defined in the `explMat.blk` file.
  This parameter is interchangeable with the explosion patch parameters above.
  Only one should be used; otherwise, the client will crash.

##### Explosion Effects

`explosionWreckage:t = "rocks_expl"`
: Defines the model used for debris or wreckage generated during explosions.

`explosionFx:t = "ground_explosion_fx"`
: Specifies the visual effect triggered during an explosion.

##### Physical Impact Modifiers

`iak:r = 0.2`
: Impulse absorption coefficient. Accepts values in the range `0.0` to `1.0`.
  `0` means no impulse is applied; `1` means full impulse is applied.

`damage_k:r = 0.3`
: Multiplier for damage applied on impact.

##### Projectile Penetration Effects

`pierceFxType:t = "ad_sand"`
: Defines the effect triggered when a projectile penetrates the material without
  being stopped. This can be overridden for specific ammunition calibers.

`pierceFxScale:p2 = 0.1, 0.2`
: Specifies the minimum and maximum scale for the `pierceFxType` effect.
  The default scale is `1.0`. Can be overridden per ammunition type.

#### Gunfire Decal Parameters

This block defines visual and physical properties for decals and effects
generated by gunfire impacts on physical materials.

##### Decal Textures

`rendinst_colorMap:t = "explosion_patch_ground_c"`
: Specifies the diffuse (albedo) texture used for gunfire decals. Transparency
  is determined by the alpha channel. If no alpha is present, the albedo
  defaults to black and a soft radial fade is applied, producing a dark circle.

`rendinst_normalMap:t = "explosion_patch_n"`
: Defines the normal map used for gunfire decals. Standard smoothness and
  metalness values are assumed unless otherwise overridden.

##### Decal Rendering Controls

The following optional parameters control which visual components of the decal
are rendered. These are useful when selectively disabling certain effects such
as color or normal influence:

`writeAlbedo:b = no`
: Disables albedo (diffuse color) rendering. Useful when only normals are
  needed.

`writeSmoothness:b = no`
: Disables the smoothness (roughness) channel rendering.

`writeNormal:b = no`
: Disables normal map rendering.

`writeMetal:b = no`
: Disables metalness rendering.

`writeShadow:b = no`
: Disables shadow casting for the decal.

##### Impact Effects

`hitFxType:t = "ad_sand"`
: Specifies the visual effect triggered upon gunfire impact.
  This can be overridden for specific ammunition calibers.

`hitFxScale:p2 = 0.1, 0.2`
: Sets the minimum and maximum scale for the `hitFxType` effect.
  Can also be overridden per ammo type.

`breachMat:t = "steel"`
: Defines the breach material type used when a projectile penetrates a vehicle.
  Common values include `"steel"` or `"wood"`, used to apply appropriate decal
  effects.

##### Vehicle Interaction Parameters

`shakeProps { period:p2 = 0.35, 0.7; power:p2 = 1, 1; mult:p2 = 0.5, 0.2; }`
: Controls wheel shake when tanks drive over this material.

  - `period` defines the frequency range of the shake.
  - `power` controls the intensity.
  - `mult` applies additional modulation.

`arcadeProps { boost:r = 1.0; }`
: Affects the arcade-mode boost calculation for tanks interacting with this
  material.

#### Deprecated or Unused Parameters

The following parameters are considered obsolete or are replaced by other
blocks:

`sizeInCalibers:r = 2`
: Not currently used.

`shakePeriod:p2 = 0.35, 0.7`
: Deprecated. Use `shakeProps` instead.

`shakePower:p2 = 1.0, 1.0`
: Deprecated. Use `shakeProps` instead.

`shakeMult:p2 = 0.5, 0.2`
: Deprecated. Use `shakeProps` instead.

`arcadeBoostMult:r = 1.0`
: Deprecated. Use `arcadeProps` instead.

### Mandatory Physmat Parameters for Render Instances

To reduce duplication, physmats are not divided into separate "prop" and
"terrain" categories. As a result, **all physmats are expected to include a
common set of parameters**, regardless of their intended use. While not all
parameters are strictly required in every case, omitting key fields can result
in missing effects or gameplay issues.

If minimal setup is required, the following parameters are empirically known to
be **mandatory** to ensure correct behavior. This list is not exhaustive:

`hitFxType:t = "ad_explosion_glass"`
: Defines the particle effect triggered on impact. Without this parameter, the
  expected visual effect will not play.

`hitFxScale:p2 = 0.1, 0.2`
: Specifies the scale range for the hit effect. If omitted, the effect will play
  at its default size, which may not suit the context.

`explMat:t = "default"` or **explosion patch parameters**
: Required for explosion handling. If neither `explMat` nor `explosionPatch`
  parameters are defined, explosion effects (e.g., tank shell impacts) may fail
  or cause visual bugs.

`tankTrack {}` and `wheel {}` blocks
: Define friction and rolling behavior for tracked and wheeled vehicles. If
  these blocks are missing, vehicles will not be able to traverse the physmat at
  all.

### Overriding Physmat Parameters in Other Configurations

Physmat parameters are frequently overridden within the configurations of other
game objects, such as landscapes, projectiles, or vehicles. This can lead to
unexpected physmat behavior if overrides conflict with the base physmat
settings.

If a physmat does not behave as intended, it is important to check related
configurations for parameter overrides. Currently, the physmat system contains
numerous such overrides, contributing to complexity and inconsistencies.

The long-term objective is to establish a clean, well-defined physmat
configuration set that minimizes or eliminates the need for overrides, thereby
simplifying maintenance and improving predictability.

#### Projectiles

Improper physmat behavior on projectiles most commonly appears in visual effects
(FX). For example, a projectile may hit concrete, but trigger a glass impact
effect, or the FX may appear at an incorrect scale (e.g. twice the intended
size).

This often results from FX overrides in projectile configuration files. All
projectile-related configurations are located at:
`<project_name>/develop/gameBase/gameData/weapons`.

Each projectile can be used by different vehicle types. To trace and validate
the applied physmat and FX settings, follow the steps below.

1. **Identify the Vehicle**

   Determine the vehicle in use by checking the mission file being launched. For
   example, the vehicle might be:

   ```text
   `ussr_t64_b_1984`
   ```

2. **Locate the Weapon Preset**

   Find the weapon preset for that vehicle in:

   ```text
   <project_name>/develop/gameBase/gameData/units/tankModels/weaponPresets
   ```

   For the example above, the corresponding file might be:

   ```text
   ussr_t_64_b_1984_common.blk
   ```

3. **Locate the Projectile Definitions**

   Assume you're inspecting machine gun behavior. The process is identical for
   all projectile types. Common weapon configurations include:

   - `groundModels_weapons/7_62mm_PKT_user_machinegun.blk`
   - `groundModels_weapons/12_7mm_NSV_user_cannon.blk`

   Open the relevant file to inspect projectile includes. Go to the relevant
   configuration files and find references to the `fx` directory at
   `<project_name>/develop/gameBase/gameData/weapons/fx` (this directory
   contains the FX settings for projectiles).

   For example, in `7_62mm_PKT_user_machinegun.blk`:

   ```blk
   include "#/develop/gameBase/gameData/weapons/bullets/USSR/_7_62mm_shkas_b32_bullet.blk"
   ```

   In turn, this bullet definition includes an FX configuration:

   ```blk
   include "#/develop/gameBase/gameData/weapons/fx/_8_11mm_ap_hit_fx.blk"
   ```

   Likewise, in `12_7mm_NSV_user_cannon.blk`:

   ```blk
   include "bullets/ussr/_12_7mm_dshk_bzt_44_APIT_bullet.blk"
   include "bullets/ussr/_12_7mm_dshk_mdz_HE_bullet.blk"
   include "bullets/ussr/_12_7mm_dshk_bs41_API_bullet.blk"
   ```

   These include references like:

   ```blk
   include "#/develop/gameBase/gameData/weapons/fx/_12_18mm_ap_hit_fx.blk"
   ```

4. **Inspect FX Configuration Files**

   Open the `.blk` files under `weapons/fx/` to review their effect definitions.

   For example, in `_12_18mm_he_hit_fx.blk`:

   ```blk
   groundCollisionEffect:t= "hit_12_18mm_dirt_he"  /* Default FX when hitting the ground.
                                                      Used if the physmat lacks a defined 'hitFxType:t'. */
   ricochetEffect:t= "hit_12_18mm_metal_ap"        // FX for ricochets on metal surfaces.
   waterCollisionEffect:t= "hit_12_18mm_water"     /* FX for impacts on water surfaces.
                                                      Also used when no specific 'hitFxType:t' is provided. */
   ```

   The file may also contain a collisions block for physmat-specific overrides:

   ```blk
   collisions{
     default{                       // physmat name
       fx:t= "hit_12_18mm_dirt_he"  // Overrides 'hitFxType:t' with a hardcoded FX for this projectile.
     }
     horLandMesh{
       fx:t= "hit_12_18mm_dirt_he"
     }
     ...
   }
   ```

## Defining Physmats in Game Resources

Physmats can be assigned to various game assets such as prefabs or ground decals
by modifying their material properties. Proper assignment ensures correct
behavior during interactions like vehicle movement, projectile impacts, and
environmental effects.

### Prefabs

To assign a physmat to a prefab, append the physmat name to the material
definition using the `@` symbol:

```blk
name:t= "lake@ice"
```

In this example, the material "lake" is associated with the ice physmat.

### Ground Decals

For decals that require explicit physmat behavior, the physmat can be defined
using the script parameter in the material properties:

```blk
script:t="phmat=concrete" // where "concrete" is the desired physmat type.
```

This assigns the concrete physmat to the decal. It is typically used for decals
that represent ground types, damage marks, or effects-sensitive surfaces.

#### Limitations and Tooling

Physmats are not currently visible in the [Asset
Viewer](../../dagor-tools/asset-viewer/asset-viewer/asset_viewer.md) or in the
[daEditor](../../dagor-tools/daeditor/daeditor/daeditor.md) and must be
verified manually:

When working with daNetGame-based projects:

- If a decal is placed on surfaces with mixed digging behavior (e.g., some allow
  shoveling, some do not), assigning a physmat to the decal is unnecessary.
- In such cases, the underlying terrain's physmat will be used during
  interactions like digging.

### Render Instances

Physmats can be applied to render instances using one of the following methods:

#### Option 1: Via Material Property

Add the physmat directly to the material definition in any `.blk` file that
describes object properties. Common files include:

- `_buildings_dmg.blk`
- `_immortals.blk`
- `rendinst_dmg.blk`

**Example:**

```blk
material:t= "ice"
```

This assigns the `ice` physmat to the render instance.

#### Option 2: Via Collision Node Script

Physmats can also be assigned through the object's collision node by adding a
script block:

```blk
script {
  phmat:t= "ice"
}
```

This method is often more precise and ensures consistent interaction behavior.

### Spline Classes

Physmats can be assigned to spline classes in two ways:

#### Method 1: Via Script Parameter

Add a `script` parameter to the spline material definition:

```blk
script:t= "phmat=rocks~r~n"
```

```{note}
If the material already uses a `script` parameter, append the physmat definition
to the existing string.
```

#### Method 2: Via Material Name

The more reliable method is to embed the physmat directly into the material name
using the `@` syntax:

```blk
matName:t= "town_pavement_asphalt_debris_a@ice"
```

This binds the `ice` physmat to the spline material.

#### Limitations

- Physmats currently apply **only to simple materials** and **loft objects**.
- Assigning physmats to materials with `class_name:t = "land_mesh_combined"` is
  **not supported** and will have no effect.

#### Export Behavior

Physmats assigned to spline classes are automatically included in the
**physmap** during level export. This ensures correct behavior in gameplay for
movement, impact effects, and interaction logic.

### Land Classes

Physmats can be assigned to land classes and are included in the physmap during
level export. Proper configuration is essential to ensure accurate in-game
physics and interaction behavior on terrain surfaces.

#### Physmat Requirements

Physmats can be stored within the landmesh, but they require a detailed
heightmap to function correctly. Without a valid heightmap, the physmat
assignment will not take effect.

#### Assigning Physmats in Landclass Files

There are two main approaches for assigning physmats in landclass definitions:

#### Method 1: Per-Channel Assignment (Splatting Mask)

Physmats can be mapped to each color channel of the splatting mask:

```blk
physMatRed:t= "beton"
physMatGreen:t= "beton"
physMatBlue:t= "beton"
physMatBlack:t= "beton"
```

```{note}
If a specific color channel is not defined, the default physmat will be used in
its place.
```

#### Method 2: Global Assignment (Single Physmat)

To apply a single physmat to the entire land class, use the `physMat` parameter
at the **root level** of the `.blk` file:

```blk
className:t= "landClass"
physMat:t= "beton"
```

```{note}
This parameter **must be placed at the root**. If nested inside another block,
it will not function.
```

#### Preventing Blending Issues

When blending materials in the splatting mask, undefined channels may fall back
to an unintended default physmat. To avoid this, always define a global
`physMat` in the root of the landclass `.blk`. This ensures a consistent
fallback.

#### Biome-Specific Physmats

In biomes, landclass physmats can be assigned globally or overridden for
specific detail indices:

```blk
physMat:t= "roadSoil"   // Global physmat applied to all details by default.

physMatIndices {        // Overrides for specific detail indices.
  detail { index:i= 4;  physMat:t= "roadSand" }
  detail { index:i= 15; physMat:t= "rocks"    }
  detail { index:i= 16; physMat:t= "beton"    }
}
```

## Testing Physmats in the Game

To verify physmat behavior in-game especially for impact effects, vehicle
interaction, or terrain response, a number of debug commands are available.

### War Thunder Debug Commands

#### `trace.debug_trace`

- Casts a debug ray from the camera to the surface.
- Places a marker (sphere) at the point of intersection.
- Displays the **name of the physmat** at that point.

  ```{note}
  Use this to confirm which physmat is being registered under the cursor in the
  game world.
  ```

```{eval-rst}
.. only:: html

   .. grid:: 1
      :class-container: center-grid

      .. grid-item::
         :class: center-cell

            :align: center
```

#### `Landmesh.checkPhysmat`

- Similar to `trace.debug_trace`, but specific to **landmesh surfaces**.
- Casts a ray and creates a debug sphere at the intersection.
- Displays the physmat name at that point.

  ```{note}
  Landmesh physmats now function without a detailed heightmap, but **only for
  visual effects and simulated interactions** (e.g., decals, FX). They do not
  support full physics interactions.
  ```

```{eval-rst}

```

#### `clipmap.physmap`

- Overlays the terrain with colors corresponding to physmats.
- Useful for visualizing physmat distribution across the level.

  ```{note}
  This command only works when `landquality:i = 0` is set in `config.blk`, or
  when the **terrain quality slider is set to Low** in the game settings.

  The color used for each physmat is not explicitly defined. It is assumed to be
  controlled by the `color:c = R,G,B,A` parameter in the physmat configuration,
  but this has not been confirmed.
  ```

  ```{eval-rst}
  .. image:: _images/physmats_05.jpg
     :alt: clipmap.physmap
     :width: 55em
     :align: center
  ```

#### `app.debug`

- Displays all active FX in the client.
- Useful for tracing visual issues, such as incorrect FX playing on impact.

  ```{note}
  If a projectile plays the wrong FX on a physmat, use this command to inspect
  the effect in real time. This allows you to trace the FX back to projectile
  configuration overrides (see the [Projectiles](#projectiles) section for
  details).
  ```

  ```{eval-rst}
  .. image:: _images/physmats_06.jpg
     :alt: clipmap.physmap
     :width: 55em
     :align: center
  ```

### Commands for daNetGame-based Projects

#### `aim.ruler <mode>`

The `aim.ruler` command traces a ray from the camera to the environment and
visualizes physmat data at the point of intersection.

Available modes:

- `aim.ruler 1`: Displays the **physmat name** and **distance** from the camera.

  ```{eval-rst}
  .. image:: _images/physmats_07.jpg
     :alt: aim.ruler 1
     :width: 55em
     :align: center
  ```

- `aim.ruler 2`: Adds **pixel-sized visual markers** for physmat representation
  at the hit point.

  ```{eval-rst}
  .. image:: _images/physmats_08.jpg
     :alt: aim.ruler 2
     :width: 55em
     :align: center
  ```

- `aim.ruler 3`: Adds a **color map overlay** showing physmat distribution
  across various surface types, including:

  - Landscapes
  - Decals
  - Road splines

  ```{eval-rst}
  .. image:: _images/physmats_09.jpg
     :alt: aim.ruler 3
     :width: 55em
     :align: center
  ```

  ```{note}
  Use this command during runtime to confirm physmat mappings and identify
  mismatches in surface interaction behavior.
  ```

### Object Destruction (Windows) by Characters

A specialized physmat named `window_wood` is used to enable window-breaking
behavior when characters jump through or push against certain objects. This
physmat is finely tuned and should not be modified directly.

```{note}
The `window_wood` physmat is configured to break only under specific physical
conditions, such as a character jumping through the window at a velocity near
`impulseSpeed:r = 2.5`. It does not trigger from light contact.
```

#### How to Enable Character-based Object Breaking

To configure destructible windows (or similar objects) for character
interaction:

1. **Assign the correct physmat**

   Replace the existing physmat (e.g., `"wood"`) with:

   ```blk
   phmat:t= "window_wood"
   ```

   in the collision node or object definition.

2. **Enable physics for the object**

   Ensure that physical collisions are active so the object can respond to
   character movement.

   ```{seealso}
   For more information, see
   [Static Object Collisions](../collisions/static_object_collision.md).
   ```

3. **Tag the object in `rendinst_dmg`**

   Add the following to the corresponding damage instance block `rendinst_dmg{}`:

   ```blk
   material:t= "window_wood"
   ```

4. **Rebuild resources**

   After making changes:

   - Rebuild [Vromfs](../../dagor-tools/building-resources/vromfs.md)
   - Rebuild **collision models** for the updated assets
