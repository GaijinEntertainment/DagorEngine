# `spline.blk`

## Blocks and Block Parameters

### `loft{}`

Procedural transparency independent of spline control points.

- `randomOpacityMulAcross:p2=1,0.2`: Random transparency variation across the
  spline.
- `randomOpacityMulAlong:p2=1,0.2`: Random transparency variation along the
  spline:
  - The first number indicates the overall reduction in the heightmap of the
    spline texture.
  - The second number indicates the delta change in the heightmap of the spline
    texture.

This feature allows for adding variation to roads and sidewalks. For example,
sand may randomly appear, blending with the tile pattern.

- `name:t="afg_road_c"`: The name of the spline.
- `matName:t="afg_road_c"`: The material reference for the spline.
- `loftLayerOrder:i=0`: Rendering layer order. The spline with the highest `i`
  value is rendered last.
- `subdivCount:i=0`: Linear subdivision between spline points (higher values
  create smoother transitions).
- `shapeSubdivCount:i=0`: Linear subdivision of the loft geometry relative to
  the spline's width, for example:

```{eval-rst}

   :gutter: 2

   .. grid-item::

      :child-align: center

      **shapeSubdivCount:i=8**

   .. grid-item::
      :child-direction: row
      :child-align: center

      **shapeSubdivCount:i=0 (or 1)**

```

- `flipUV:b=0`: Swaps the `u` and `v` channels in the UVW mapping.
- `vTile:r=1.0`: Texture scaling along the spline width, for example:

```{eval-rst}
.. grid:: 3
   :class-container: center-grid
   :gutter: 2

   .. grid-item::
      :child-direction: row
      :child-align: center

      .. image:: _images/spline_blk_07.jpg
         :width: 30em
         :align: center

```

- `uSize:r=10.0`: Texture scaling along the spline length.

  The ratio of `uSize` to `vTile` is directly influenced by the parameters in
  the [`shape{}` block](#shape).

- `extrude:b=0`: When set to `1`, the loft geometry is extruded (gains
  thickness)

  ```{note}
  This parameter currently has no effect.
  ```

- `cullcw:b=0`: Inverts the spline normals.
- `offset:p2=0, 0`: Offsets the loft geometry relative to the spline:
  - The first value offsets the loft relative to the spline width.
  - The second value offsets the loft vertically relative to the spline:

```{eval-rst}
.. grid:: 2
   :class-container: center-grid
   :gutter: 2

   .. grid-item::
      :child-direction: row
      :child-align: center

      **offset:p2 = 0, 0**

   .. grid-item::

```

- `placeAboveHt:r=100`: Distance from the heightmap to the spline where the
  spline projection occurs.

The following parameters apply only to lofts. If the spline only projects a
texture and is not baked, this section can be omitted. If this block is enabled,
a check will always be performed, potentially causing long load times (up to
several minutes) in the
[daEditor](../../dagor-tools/daeditor/daeditor/daeditor.md).

- `roadBehavior:b=0`: Enables the road behavior block. If disabled, the loft is
  placed directly onto the landscape mesh. This setting is rarely needed (95% of
  cases).
- `htTestStep:r=100`: Number of points between spline control points where
  conditions for `followHills` and `followHollows` will be checked. Cannot be
  zero (could crash the
  [daEditor](../../dagor-tools/daeditor/daeditor/daeditor.md)).
- `followHills:b=0`: Ensures the loft is not drawn beneath hills (lifts the loft
  to match hill height when enabled).
- `followHollows:b=0`: Ensures the loft is not drawn over depressions (lowers
  the loft to match the depth when enabled).
- `maxHerr:r=1.5`: (Needs clarification).
- `roadTestWidth:r=4.0`: Distance from the center of the spline where conditions
  of this block are tested.
- `curvatureStrength:r=0`: Controls the influence of spline curvature on loft
  geometry subdivision.
- `minStep:r=1`: Minimum distance between subdivisions, in meters.
- `maxStep:r=1000`: Maximum subdivision distance, in meters.

**Examples**:

- `curvatureStrength:r=1`, `minStep:r=1`, `maxStep:r=100`: Subdivides the loft
  where needed based on spline curvature, reducing unnecessary triangles:

  <img src="_images/spline_blk_12.jpg" align="center" width="50em">

- `curvatureStrength:r=0`, `minStep:r=1`, `maxStep:r=4`: Evenly spaced loft
  subdivisions, independent of spline curvature.

  <img src="_images/spline_blk_13.jpg" align="center" width="50em">

- `curvatureStrength:r=0`, `minStep:r=1`, `maxStep:r=1000`: Optimized for
  splines with two points and linear interpolation.

  <img src="_images/spline_blk_14.jpg" align="center" width="50em">

- `integral_mapping_length:b=0`: When set to `1`, calculates [arc
  length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_length) using integration.

- `sweepWidth:r=200`: Removes render instances generated by landclasses (e.g.,
  trees or houses intersecting with roads or riverbanks).

- `addFuzzySweepHalfWidth:r=50`: Creates a "rough" mask or scatter effect
  (should not exceed the value of `sweepWidth`).

- `sweep2Width:r=50`: Removes render instances even generated by this spline in
  the `objGen{}` block (useful for intersections of roads, e.g., an asphalt road
  with a tree-lined avenue intersecting a dirt road).

### `node_flags{}`

- `renderable:b=1`: Enables rendering of the loft.
- `collidable:b=1`: Enables collision for the loft.

### `shape{}`

- `closed:b=0`: Closes the loft's cross-section.

The `shape{}` block manages the positions of the loft profile points. A minimum
of two points is required.

**Example**:

- `pt:p4= -5.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0` where:
  - `-5.0`: Offset of the point along the spline's width, 5 meters from the
    center.
  - `0.0`: Vertical offset of the point, relative to the spline (no vertical
    offset).
  - `1.0`: UV coordinate shift along the spline's length (this parameter has no
    effect).
  - `0.0`: UV coordinate shift along the spline's width.

**Example**:

- `pt:p4= 5.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0`: This point is offset 5 meters in the opposite
  direction, with the same vertical and UV settings.

```{eval-rst}
.. grid:: 2
   :class-container: center-grid
   :gutter: 2

   .. grid-item::
      :class: center-cell

      .. image:: _images/spline_blk_15.jpg
         :width: 40em
         :align: center

   .. grid-item::
      :class: center-cell

      .. image:: _images/spline_blk_16.jpg
         :width: 40em
         :align: center

```

The final loft will have a width of 10 meters and be vertically aligned with the
spline's control points (see screenshot). The ratio of `vTile` to `uSize` is
1:10 (as described above).

**Example of a more complex curved profile**:

- `pt:p4= -7.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0`
- `pt:p4= -5.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.2`
- `pt:p4=  5.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.8`
- `pt:p4= 7.5, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0`

```{eval-rst}
.. grid:: 2
   :class-container: center-grid
   :gutter: 2

   .. grid-item::
      :class: center-cell

      .. image:: _images/spline_blk_17.jpg
         :width: 40em
         :align: center

   .. grid-item::
      :class: center-cell

      .. image:: _images/spline_blk_18.jpg
         :width: 40em
         :align: center

```

The final loft will have a width of 15 meters (ranging from -7.5 to 7.5 meters)
and will be vertically aligned with the spline control points. The middle
section, 10 meters wide, will be raised 1 meter above the spline.

In the example above, the triangles of the loft behave uniformly. To
differentiate the behavior of points in the loft, the `group{}` block is used.

**Example**:

```text
group{
  pt:p4= -7.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0
}

group{
  pt:p4= -5.0, 1.0, 0.25, 0.25
  pt:p4= 5.0, 1.0, 0.75, 0.75
}

group{
  pt:p4= 7.5, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0
}
```

Grouping loft points defines their varying behavior.

**Example**:

```text
group{
  type:t="rel_to_collision"
  pt:p4= -7.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0
}

group{
  type:t="move_to_min"
  pt:p4= -5.0, 1.0, 0.25, 0.25
  pt:p4= 5.0, 1.0, 0.75, 0.75
}

group{
  type:t="rel_to_collision"
  pt:p4= 7.5, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0
}
```

```{eval-rst}
.. grid:: 2
   :class-container: center-grid
   :gutter: 2

   .. grid-item::
      :class: center-cell

      .. image:: _images/spline_blk_19.jpg
         :width: 40em
         :align: center

   .. grid-item::
      :class: center-cell

      .. image:: _images/spline_blk_20.jpg
         :width: 40em
         :align: center

```
The resulting loft consists of three groups. The vertical positions of the
middle group's points match the lowest vertical coordinate of the spline's
control points (`type:t="move_to_min"`). The two outer groups are "dropped" onto
the collision object (in this case, the heightmap is used as the collision).

### `colliders{}`

The `colliders{}` block defines the objects with which the spline collides.

- `use:t="HeightMap"`: Collides with the heightmap.
- `use:t="(srv) Prefab entities"`: Collides with prefab entities.
- `use:t="(filter) Generated by spline"`: Collides with objects generated by the
  spline itself.
- `use:t="SGeometry"`: Collides with scene geometry.

### `obj_generate{}`

The `obj_generate{}` block is responsible for placing objects along the
spline.

- `rseed:i = 111`: Random seed for generating random values. It is essential to
  use unique seeds for different `obj_generate{}` blocks; otherwise, it will
  cause a syntax error.

- `setSeedToEntities:b=yes`: Enables randomization for composite objects.
  Without this, the same random element will be generated repeatedly, instead of
  different ones each time.

- `placeAtPoint:b=true`: Places objects at the spline points, which is useful
  for precise placements, such as poles in a city. The step value (discussed
  below) will also apply.

- `step:p2 = 10, 0`: The first value is the distance (step) between objects,
  while the second value defines a range for random variation. For example:
  - `step:p2 = 10, 0`: Objects are placed exactly 10 meters apart.
  - `step:p2 = 10, 2`: A random value between 0 and 2 meters is added (or
    subtracted) to the 10-meter step, creating varied distances between objects.

  <img src="_images/spline_blk_21.jpg" align="center" width="50em">

  <img src="_images/spline_blk_22.jpg" align="center" width="50em">

When using the `genTag` system, the step must be larger than the widest object's
width. Otherwise, the distance between objects will be determined by the `step`,
not the object's width.

- `offset:p2 = 0.0, 0.0`: The first value shifts the object's position along the
  spline, and the second defines the range for random variation.

- `placeAboveHt:r=100`: Objects are projected onto the ground within a 100-meter
  distance.

- `startPadding:r=3.5; endPadding:r=3.5`: These parameters define the exclusion
  zones at the start and end of the spline, where no objects will be generated.

- `orientation:t="normal"`: Controls the orientation of the objects during
  placement. Possible values include:
  - `orientation:t="normal"`: Objects are not aligned; their tilt depends on the
    surface's normal beneath them.

    <img src="_images/spline_blk_23.jpg" align="center" width="50em">

  - `orientation:t="fence"`: Objects are aligned along the spline, with no tilt.

    <img src="_images/spline_blk_24.jpg" align="center" width="50em">

  - `orientation:t="fence_normal"`: Objects are aligned along the spline, and
    their tilt depends on the surface's normal.

    <img src="_images/spline_blk_25.jpg" align="center" width="50em">

- `tightFenceOrient:b=yes`: Aligns objects along chords. As the name suggests,
  this is useful for fences. Instead of placing objects on the spline itself,
  they are positioned on a chord defined by the object's width. Chords are
  generated along the spline until they fit within its length. If the last chord
  is shorter than the object's width, the object will not be generated, leaving
  a gap. To avoid gaps, you can use "filler" objects by setting
  `integral_end_entity:b=yes`.

  <img src="_images/spline_blk_26.jpg" align="center" width="50em">

- `tightFenceIntegral:t="spline"`: Makes chords ignore spline nodes.

- `tightFenceIntegral:t="segment"`: Treats each segment of the spline as a
  separate spline. Useful for generating fences along irregular contours.

- `tightFenceIntegral:t="corner"`: Filler objects are placed only at corners.

- `placeAtVeryStart:b=yes` and `placeAtVeryEnd:b=yes`: Ensures objects are
  placed at the very start or end of the spline, regardless of their frequency
  or padding.

To add unique objects at the start or end of the spline (without repetition
along the middle), use a zero step: `step:p2 = 0, 0`.

### `object{}`

These parameters relate to the objects themselves, as defined in the `object{}`
block.

**Example**:

```text
object{
  genTag:t="a"
  width:r=17
  name:t="modern_siding_suburb_building_a"
  weight:r=1

  rot_x:p2=0, 0
  rot_y:p2=0, 0
  rot_z:p2=0, 0

  offset_x:p2= 0, 0
  offset_y:p2= 0, 0
  offset_z:p2= 12, 0

  scale:p2=1.0, 0.0
  yScale:p2=1.0, 0
}
```

Where:

- `genTagSeq:t="a"`: The sequence (pattern) of objects used for placement.
  - `genTagSeq:t="a"`: Only objects with `genTag:t="a"` will be placed. If there
   are multiple objects with the same tag, they will be randomly selected, and
   their selection frequency is controlled by `weight`. If the sequence contains
   multiple identical tags (e.g., `genTagSeq:t="aaaaaaa"` or `genTagSeq:t="a"`),
   the result is the same.
  - `genTagSeq:t="ab"`: Alternates between objects with `genTag:t="a"` and
    `genTag:t="b"`.
  - `genTagSeq:t="abbccaccabcca"`: Alternates between objects with four
    different `genTags`.

**Examples**:

- `genTagSeq:t="a"`

  <img src="_images/spline_blk_27.jpg"  align="center" width="50em">

- `genTagSeq:t="ab"`

  <img src="_images/spline_blk_28.jpg"  align="center" width="50em">

- `genTagSeq:t="abc"`

  <img src="_images/spline_blk_29.jpg"  align="center" width="50em">

- `width:r=17`: Distance between consecutive objects of the current type (17
  meters in this case).

- `name:t="modern_siding_suburb_building_a"`: Reference to the object.

- `weight:r=1`: The probability (frequency) of selecting this object when
  randomly chosen from a group of objects with the same `genTag`.

- `rot_x, rot_y, rot_z`: Rotation of the object in three planes with a random
  value.

- `offset_x, offset_y, offset_z`: Random offsets along the three axes.

- `scale:p2`: Uniform scale with a random value.

- `yScale:p2`: Vertical scale with a random value.

- `integral_end_entity:b=yes`: Marks the object as a "filler" when using
  `tightFenceOrient`. This object will be scaled or stretched to fit the
  remaining spline length. This parameter only affects the last object in a
  sequence.

Objects marked with `integral_end_entity` may not be generated (if their
`genTag` is not used in `genTagSeq`) but will still be used as fillers at the
end of the spline.

For correct operation and to avoid excessive distortion, it is recommended to
create multiple filler objects. Typically, in addition to the main object, you
should have three-quarter, half, and quarter-length versions. To allow scaling,
specify values in the `xzScale:p2` parameter.

## Shape to Loft HDA

The script, you can download here
{download}`dgr_shape_to_loft.hda<_images/dgr_shape_to_loft.hda>`,
converts a polygonal shape into the coordinates of loft points, allowing these
values to be substituted into a spline class.

The tool is designed to facilitate the translation of polygonal geometry into a
usable format for lofting, enabling smoother integration of custom shapes into
spline-based workflows.

## Loft Geometry Visualization Setup

To visually display the loft geometry in the editor and adjust the parameters:

1. Open the `*.mat.blk` file and set `render_landmesh_combined=0` to
   `render_landmesh_combined=1`.
2. Open the `*.spline.blk` file and press `Ctrl`+`S` to apply the changes made
   to `*.mat.blk`.

The wireframe of the loft geometry will then be visible by pressing `F3`.
