# `.composit.blk`

## What is a Composite Object?

A composite object is not an object, but a text file in the BLK format, which
contains a list of reference objects and some of their parameters. These files
are named according to specific conventions and always include one of the
following suffixes:

- `_cmp.composit.blk`: Simple composite object.
- `_random.composit.blk`: Composite object with randomness (replacing objects or
  making objects disappear).
- `_gameobj.composit.blk`: Composite object containing game objects.

The primary purpose of composite objects is to simplify the work of level
designers. For example, they can assemble a house with interior elements without
manually placing each element every time.

From the game's perspective, there is no difference between objects placed
individually or by a composite object. In the game, all objects from the
composite file are loaded as independent objects.

```{note}
The game engine does not recognize composite objects; they are solely
for convenience in arranging and editing sets of objects on a map. Only the
objects themselves (render instances, prefabs, etc.) are exported into the game
level. Composite files (`.blk` files) are not used beyond the editor.
```

## Contents of `.composit.blk` Files

Composite objects consist of an enumeration of objects with certain parameters:

- Object names.
- Placement coordinates.
- Probability of including an object (or replacing it with another or with an
  empty space).

## Example of Declaring a Single Object

```text
className:t="composit"
node{
  name:t="obj_name:rendInst"
  tm:m=[[1, 0, 0] [0, 1, 0] [0, 0, 1] [0, 0, 0]]
}
```

In this example:

- `className:t="composit"`: Indicates that this `.blk` file will be treated as a
  composite by the engine.
- `node{}`: Represents an individual building block of our composite object
  (node). Ensure all curly braces are correctly matched; a missing or extra
  brace will break the composite.
- `name:t="obj_name:rendInst"`: Specifies the name and type of the node. Here,
  "obj_name" is a render instance.

If there are no "duplicates" (objects with the same name but different types),
you can simply specify the name without a type:

```text
name:t="obj_name"
```

This simple naming indicates the object's placement at specified coordinates
without additional parameters like disappearance or replacement.

By all means, you shouldn't have any cases when type specification is necessary:
it is required only when there are full namesakes of different types, for
example "asset:rendinst" (`asset.lod00.dag`), "asset:composit"
(`asset.composit.blk`) and "asset:prefab" (`asset.dag`), which should not be
done at all.

If there are no namesakes, it is sufficient to record without specifying the
type: `name:t="obj_name"`.

This is a simple object name. Simple in the sense that we can't do anything with
it (set the probability of disappearance, substitution by another object, etc.).
We just say that there is such an object at such coordinates. If this string is
missing or `name:t=""`, then the node will be "empty" – no asset will be drawn
in it.

We can set here either a rendInst, a composite or a game object (discussed
below). Composite doesn't care what it refers to – it's just a text file with a
list of objects placed in certain places. Names are given without extensions.
That is, instead of `table_a.lod00.dag`, you should just specify `table_a`. Or,
instead of `table_a_plates_cmp.composit.blk`, we set `table_a_plates_cmp`.

```{important}
For the tools, the **asset that was found earlier is prioritized**. For example,
from two objects in the same directory `table_a.composit.blk` and
`table_a.lod00.dag` the engine will call `table_a.composit.blk` (in alphabetical
order `.composit` will be found before `.lod`), but if the composite, for
example, is in the subdirectory `composits/`, then the first will be the
`.lod`. Thus, simply rearranging resources in a new way can break a
compositor referring to "namesakes" without an explicitly specified type.

For this reason, it is often an error when a composite refers to a `.dag` of
the same name. That is, a `table_a` rendinst is specified inside
`table_a.composit.blk`. The engine will not call the `table_a` rendInst – it
will call the  `table_a` composite. Because of this, we get into recursion
(when an object refers to itself an infinite number of times).

So always call composites by content. For example,
`is_table_a_dinner_chairs_cmp.composit.blk` (a dining table with chairs), or
`is_book_case_shelf_0_7m_a_cmp.composit.blk` (a 0.7-meter shelf for a bookcase).

However, there are still situations when you want to set the same names. For
example, we already have `table_a` (rendinst) in multiple places. And, after two
years, it became necessary to put plates on it.

We can make a composite `table_a_plates_cmp.composit.blk`, in which to add
plates and replace it in these multiple places (and then overwrite it with
future edits).
```

This is the matrix of the object:

```text
tm:m=[[1, 0, 0] [0, 1, 0] [0, 0, 1] [0, 0, 0]]
```

```{note}
This is a matrix, not an indication of the object's rotation in degrees or
scales in percent. **Do not try to pick up parameters through a text editor**.
They should be generated by a script or obtained when creating a composite
object in one of the editors. Only the last block of the matrix is the position
of the object in space, in meters. This block can be edited through a text
editor.
```

If no matrix is specified at all, it will be equal to the one above. Zero
offsets and rotation, unit size.

```{note}
The matrix specifies the transforms relative to the **parent** of our node.
In the example above, the parent is the composite itself, i.e. the offset is
specified relative to the pivot of the entire composite. However, this is not
always the case. More on this later.
```

## Example of Declaring a Random Node

If we want one of several variants to be placed in the specified coordinates
instead of one particular asset, then we need to specify the node differently.

```text
node{
  ent{
    name:t="obj_name1"; weight:r=1;
  }
  ent{
    name:t="obj_name2"; weight:r=1;
  }
}
```

Here, instead of always having the same asset, we randomly choose one of the two
with equal probability. There can also be other parameters inside `node{}`, such
as a matrix. Only `"name:t"` cannot be specified at the same time as `ent{}`.

```text
ent{}
```

This is how an **entity block** is allocated – there can be several of them
inside a node, but only one at a time will be output.

Accordingly, if we specify only one `ent{}` block, we will get exactly the same
result as in the first example. There is always only one option to choose from.

Inside there is already familiar to us parameter `name:t`, which works exactly
the same way as in nodes. In addition, a new parameter `weight:r` has been
added. If the parameter was not specified, it would be equal to `1` by default.

The higher its value **is compared to the weight of other nodes**, the higher
the probability that random will choose this option. The weight can be written
in any "dimension" – 0.0001 or 1000 – it is not the number itself that matters,
but how much it is greater/lower than the weight of its neighbors. We specify
the values that are easier to perceive.

```{note}
Unlike nodes, entities do not have their own matrix and other parameters. Only
the name and weight. The rest of the parameters are taken from the node in which
they are located.
```

The syntax allows you to separate entity parameters not only by semicolon, but
also by jumping to the new line. The two methods in the example below are
equivalent. Tabulation is used only to improve readability, in fact it will work
without indentation, and all blocks are separated only by curly braces.

```text
ent{name:t="obj_name"; weight:r=1;}

ent{
  name:t="obj_name"
  weight:r=1
}
```

When creating a random node in a text editor, the second option may be more
convenient if the entity name is very long.

What should we do if we want to sometimes not spawn anything? Add the empty
entity mentioned earlier. As we remember, an empty name or no `name:t` parameter
will give us an empty node:

```text
node{
  ent{
    name:t="obj_name1"; weight:r=1;
  }
  ent{
    name:t="obj_name2"; weight:r=1;
  }
  ent{
    name:t=""; weight:r=2;
  }
}
```

Now half the time nothing is drawn, because the weight of the empty node is
equal to the total weight of the other entities.

```{note}
If you have built a composite that randomizes a single node (e.g. a chair to a
similar one) – it's a must to give it a name `*_random.composit.blk` – a simple
composite object.
```

It will work without it. But this composite will be arranged by a human, and the
search needs a meaningful name that explains what is inside without having to
open each `.blk` file and check the contents.

## Example of Declaring Multiple Objects

Let's reinforce our knowledge by going through the same steps multiple times. In
practice, it's unnecessary to use different node formats side by side (as it can
complicate readability), but each method works.

```text
className:t="composit"

// Standard object declaration. Without a specified matrix, it will have zero
rotation, zero offset, and a scale of `1`:

node{
  name:t="obj_name0"
}

// Random entity with a single option behaves the same as the block above.
The "default" matrix is identical to its absence:

node{
  ent{
    name:t="obj_name1"; weight:r=1;
  }
  tm:m=[[1, 0, 0] [0, 1, 0] [0, 0, 1] [0, 0, 0]]
}

// One of the objects or nothing is chosen with equal probability:

node{
  ent{
    name:t="obj_name2" // Parameters can be separated by line breaks.
    weight:r=1
  }
  ent{
    name:t="obj_name3"; weight:r=1; // Or by semicolons.
  }
  ent{
    name:t=""; weight:r=1;
  }
  tm:m=[[1, 0, 0] [0, 1, 0] [0, 0, 1] [0, 0, 0]]
}
```

## Example of Declaring Random Transforms

As we discussed earlier, using a different format is required to select from
multiple entities. The process is similar for random object placement – rather
than a matrix, we use special parameters.

### Available Parameters for Randomization

```text
node{
  offset_x:p2=0, 0
  offset_y:p2=0, 0
  offset_z:p2=0, 0
  rot_x:p2=0, 0
  rot_y:p2=0, 0
  rot_z:p2=0, 0
  scale:p2=1, 0
  yScale:p2=1, 0
}
```

All the parameters are optional but cannot be used simultaneously with a
matrix. If a matrix is specified, any of these will be ignored.

- `offset_*:p2`: Specifies the object's position along the corresponding axes in
  meters. Replace the `*` with the axis letter. The first value is the absolute
  offset, and the second is the allowed deviation in both directions after that.
  For example, a value of `3, 0.5` means the final coordinate will be between
  2.5 and 3.5 meters. If unspecified, it defaults to `0, 0`.
- `rot_*:p2`: Similarly specifies rotation in degrees. To set any random
  rotation around an axis, just input `0, 180` – random values will cover a full
  rotation around the axis (from −180° to 180°). Defaults to `0, 0` if
  unspecified.
- `yScale:p2`: Unlike rotation and offset, scaling on all axes cannot be
  randomized independently. The exception is the Y-axis, which points upward in
  Dagor. The first value is the initial scale, and the second is the deviation.
  Defaults to `1, 0` if unspecified.
- `scale:p2`: Uniform scaling on all axes. Defaults to `1, 0` and can be used
  alongside Y-axis scaling.

### Random Transforms for Multiple Composites Simultaneously

The example above is inconvenient when controlling multiple composites
simultaneously, such as creating randomly slightly open windows using multiple
rendering instances for visual variety. Each shutter could be assigned its
random rotation parameter, but making adjustments would be cumbersome. To change
the angle, you'd have to go through all references to these shutters in every
composite – slow and prone to error. To avoid this, parameters can be placed in
a separate `.blk`.

### Structure of a File with Random Transforms and Naming Conventions

Technically, the composite will accept any name, but since people will work with
them, the file name should be meaningful. Common suffixes are `_rot.blk` for
rotations, `_offset.blk` for offsets, or `_transform.blk` for both in a general
file. If some objects have left and right versions with different rotation
directions, add the suffixes `_l` and `_r` accordingly.

For example, for left window shutters, it makes sense to create a file
`_shutter_rot_l.blk` with:

```text
rot_y:p2=85, 5
rot_z:p2=0, 0.8
```
And for the right ones, `_shutter_rot_r.blk` with the corresponding rotations
for the right side. This file can then be included in the composite of the
shutter, for example,
`name_city_house_window_shutter_1200x1900_a_l_cmp.composit.blk`:

```text
className:t="composit"

node{
  name:t="name_city_house_window_shutter_1200x1900_a_l"
  include "_shutter_rot_l.blk"
}
```

```{important}
- The path to the `_shutter_rot_l.blk` file is absolute. In the example above,
  the including file is in the same directory as the composite. If you place
  this file elsewhere, specify the full path in the command line format.
- We are effectively substituting the shutter's
  `name_city_house_window_shutter_1200x1900_a_l.lod00.dag` file with a composite
  that has a random rotation,
  `name_city_house_window_shutter_1200x1900_a_l_cmp.composit.blk`. This means we
  include this `_shutter_rot_l.blk` in the composite of a single shutter –
  nothing else is there. This is the composite that will later be placed in the
  windows, instead of the shutter itself.
```

### Why Use Includes in Nested Composites?

- **Priority of the Matrix**: Remember, the matrix has a higher priority. If the
  node is not at the "zero" of the composite, the only way to change its
  position is through random offset parameters along the unused axes.

- **Avoid Doing This in the "Outer" Composite, Though It Works:**

```text
className:t="composit"
node{
  name:t="name_city_house_window_shutter_1200x1900_a_l"
  include "_shutter_rot_l.blk"
  offset_y:p2=0.7, 0
  offset_x:p2=1, 0
  offset_z:p2=2, 0
}
node{
  name:t="name_city_house_window_shutter_1200x1900_a_l"
  include "_shutter_rot_l.blk"
  offset_y:p2=0.7, 0
  offset_x:p2=1, 0
  offset_z:p2=-2, 0
}
```

This will work and move the shutter to the specified coordinates, but all
editors currently operate with matrices by default – exporting transforms this
way won't be possible. Positioning with this way is only feasible through
blind manual `.blk` editing – not the most convenient or fastest method.

- **Potential for Duplicate Transformations**: Without seeing the contents of
  the included `.blk`, it's easy to duplicate non-visible transformations, which
  can lead to bugs. Each `include` is replaced on the fly with the contents of
  the specified file. If a parameter is specified twice, only the first instance
  will be applied.

Here's how inattentiveness can break things:

```text
className:t="composit"
node{
  name:t="name_city_house_window_shutter_1200x1900_a_l"
  rot_y:p2=90, 0  // First transformation specified before include, shutter will
  include "_shutter_rot_l.blk" // always stick at 90°, ignoring Y randomization
}
node{
  name:t="name_city_house_window_shutter_1200x1900_a_l"
  include "_shutter_rot_l.blk"
  rot_y:p2=90, 0 // Second declaration of a parameter already present in the
                 // include – attempting to rotate an additional 90° on Y will
                 // be ignored.
}
```

## Example of Node Hierarchy in Composites

Inside the `node{}` block, there can be more than just a list of its parameters.
Another `node{}` can be placed inside. In this case, the inner node is
considered a child, and its transforms are calculated not from zero but from the
parent's matrix.

```text
className:t="composit"

node{
  tm:m=[[1, 0, 0] [0, 1, 0] [0, 0, 1] [0, 1, 0]]
  node{
    name:t="obj_name0"
    tm:m=[[1, 0, 0] [0, 1, 0] [0, 0, 1] [0, 0, 1]]
  }
}
```

In the example above, `"obj_name0"` is written inside another `node{}`, meaning
it inherits the offset. The upper node is an "empty" one with an offset of one
meter along the Y-axis. The node with the object has an offset of `1` meter
along the Z-axis in its matrix, but remember that matrices combine. Relative to
the composite's center, it will be offset along both Y and Z. We can set other
coordinates for it, add another block with different objects next to it, etc.

It's not frequently used, but it's possible. Composites are exported from
[daEditor](../../dagor-tools/daeditor/daeditor/daeditor.md) this way – all nodes
are parented to an empty node with a default matrix. In text form, such
composites are harder to perceive, and until recently, we didn't have the
ability to visually edit composites, so practical use is still rare.

### Practical Example of Node Hierarchy Use

Let's imagine we have two tables 0.7 meters tall and two cups. We want one of
the tables to be randomly selected in the composite and rotated. The cups should
also be chosen randomly, placed near one side, and shifted only along the
table's length. They should also rotate and, perhaps, sometimes not appear at
all. We can implement this as follows:

```text
className:t="composit"

node{
  rot_y:p2=0, 10
  ent{
    name:t="table_a";
  }
  ent{
    name:t="table_b";
  }
  node{
    offset_y:p2=0.7, 0
    offset_z:p2=0.2, 0.05
    offset_x:p2=0, 0.25
    rot_y:p2=0, 180
    ent{
      name:t="cup_a";
    }
    ent{
      name:t="cup_b";
    }
    ent{
      name:t="";
    }
  }
}
```

Breaking it down:
- The parent node has a random rotation from −10° to 10°. One of the tables is
  drawn with equal probability since each entity has a weight of one, as we
  didn't manually set a different value.
- The cup node is nested inside the table node, meaning its offset occurs
  relative to the table, considering its rotation. Afterward, an absolute offset
  of 0.7 meters upward is added – the cup should always be on the tabletop, no
  randomization needed. But since we want to randomize other transforms, we
  can't use a matrix, so we set it this way.
- We then shift closer to the edge by 0.2 meters to place it off-center and add
  a bit of randomness – from 0.15 to 0.25, so it doesn't fall off at the
  extremes.
- Along the table's length, the distance is more significant – let it randomize
  equally in both directions. The absolute offset is not set, and the deviation
  is from −0.25 to 0.25 meters.
- Finally, we add a completely random rotation – from −180° to 180°.

<img src="_images/composit_blk_01.jpg" alt="Randomized rotation" align="center" width="30em">

```{important}
For one-time use, this approach is faster than the old method, where a separate
subcomposite was created for each random element. One for selecting cups and
their rotation. Another for choosing the table. Then one for placing the cup on
the table with an offset. And finally, the top-level one, which slightly rotates
the table with the cup on it. But here – just one. However, if cups are to be
placed, for example, on shelves or in cabinets, it makes more sense to store
them in their own subcomposite so you don't have to add a third cup to the
table, cabinet, and shelf composites one by one. If cups are only found on these
tables for some reason, then yes, don't create unnecessary entities.

Thus, the correct application of this approach is for parts of a whole, which
shouldn't be found with the same set of transforms. For example, randomly
opening car doors, the hood, or the whole/intact/missing windshield in their
coordinates relative to the body can be done this way. Similarly, cabinet doors,
unless it's a modular system with the possibility of attachment at different
coordinates.

If composite parts might be needed elsewhere, move them to a subcomposite to
simplify reuse and potential future edits. If a node with certain transforms and
randomness is only required once, for example, as part of a unique object, the
single composite approach is preferable.
```

## Game Objects

### Overview

Game objects, or `gameObj`, are interactive elements within the game that are
dynamic and have a direct impact on gameplay. Examples of such objects include
health kits, ammunition, weapons, and other equipment. These objects are
automatically generated from an object known as `loot_box`.

Typically, these objects are placed on various horizontal surfaces such as
tables, chairs, shelves, and cabinets.

### Example Node Description

```text
node{
  name:t="loot_box:gameObj"
  tm:m=[[0.3, 0, 0] [0, 0.3, 0] [0, 0, 0.3] [0, 0.6, 0]]
}
```

In this block `name:t="loot_box:gameObj"` specifies the object name along with
its type. The format is mandatory.

As discussed earlier, while omitting the type might work if there are no
conflicting assets of different types, it is crucial to specify the type when
editing the composite in text format. This ensures clarity and prevents
errors.

### Creation Process

Unfortunately, these nodes are not generated automatically through
[dag2riRes](../../dagor-tools/dag2rires/dag2rires.md) or the
[daEditor](../../dagor-tools/daeditor/daeditor/daeditor.md). They must be
manually scripted.

You can (and should) place a cube named `loot_box` at the desired locations in
your scene/editor and then export them into a composite. The placement process
is identical to that of regular render instances. However, all these cubes will
initially be recorded as:

```text
name:t="loot_box"
```

Therefore, after exporting, you will need to manually update each of these
objects within the composite, assigning them the correct parameters as described
above.

```{important}
After adding game objects to a composite, it is **mandatory** to name it using
the format `*_gameobj.composit.blk` to distinguish it as a simple composite
object.
```

### Other Types of Game Objects

`loot_box` is not the only type of game object that needs to be placed in the
environment. Other commonly used game objects include `indoor_wall`,
`wall_hole`, and `envi_probe` for accurate indoor lighting and reflections,
vertical ladders, light sources, such as flickering lights, and many more.

## Chain Destruction and Composite Nodes

### Chain Destruction

We can assign certain assets the *parent* type within the game's parameters (not
within the models – this is done in our internal `.blk` files). All objects
without an assigned *parent* are considered *children*. When a *parent* is
destroyed, all *children* whose collisions intersect the bounding box of the
*parent* will also be destroyed.

```{important}
The system operates strictly as follows: **One *parent* destroys all *children*
whose collisions intersect its bounding box.**

This means:

- *Children* cannot destroy *parents*.
- *Children* **cannot** destroy other *children*. Only those *children* whose
collisions intersect the bounding box of the *parent* will be destroyed.
- No subsequent chain of destruction will occur; the system is rigid and does
not support additional logic beyond these rules.

```

#### Examples

Let's take an example, where we have an urn as a *parent*:

<img src="_images/composit_blk_02.jpg" alt="Urn as a parent" align="center" width="20em">

and an amphora as a *child*:

<img src="_images/composit_blk_03.jpg" alt="Amphora as a child" align="center" width="20em">

**Placement Scenario 1:** All correct. The *child's* collision (the "spike"
at the bottom) enters the bounding box of the *parent* urn. Destroy the
*parent*, and the amphora will also be destroyed.

<img src="_images/composit_blk_04.jpg" alt="Placement Scenario 1" align="center" width="20em">

**Placement Scenario 2:** Ambiguous. If we want to destroy the amphora
through the urn, it's correct – the side collision of the amphora enters the
urn's bounding box. But if we don't want that (since the amphora is just
standing next to the urn, not on it), it's incorrect. The amphora will be
destroyed because of the urn.

<img src="_images/composit_blk_05.jpg" alt="Placement Scenario 2" align="center" width="20em">

**Placement Scenario 3:** Incorrect. The *parent* urn is hanging in the air.
Destroy it, and the amphora will collapse too. But if we destroy the amphora,
the *parent* urn will remain hanging.

<img src="_images/composit_blk_06.jpg" alt="Placement Scenario 3" align="center" width="20em">

**Placement Scenario 4:** Incorrect. When the *parent* urn is destroyed, only
the middle amphora will be destroyed because its collision enters the *parent's*
bounding box. The top amphora will remain hanging in the air.

<img src="_images/composit_blk_07.jpg" alt="Placement Scenario 4" align="center" width="20em">

**Placement Scenario 5:** As an exception, *parents* can destroy other *parents*
following the same rules (and only within the immediate "circle" – collision
contact with the first destroyed *parent* is required). A special parameter must
be manually defined in the properties (in the same `.blk` files) to enable this.
It is not a default behavior for all *parents*, but a specific feature.

<img src="_images/composit_blk_08.jpg" alt="Placement Scenario 5" align="center" width="50em">

```{important}
Do not overuse this feature, as it is difficult to predict how and where objects
will be positioned in the game. For instance, we once allowed this *parent*
barrel to destroy other *parents*. It successfully took down a *parent* tent and
*parent* ammunition crates, as shown above.
```

### Object Placement Rules

**Why Discuss Destruction in this Section?**

Because developers often forget that **the game knows nothing about
composites.** This has already been emphasized multiple times at the beginning,
and let's discuss it again.

Only the objects and their matrices are exported into the game. A vast hierarchy
of a house with decorators, down to the last random composite vase, will be
exported into the game as a hundred objects with matrices. **No composites will
exist in the game!**

Similarly, objects cannot just destroy their neighbors arbitrarily. Only
*parents* destroy *children* (and sometimes other *parents*).

Thus, do not create composites where objects are stacked mindlessly on top of
each other! **A composite is not magic.** It's merely a list of objects – it
won't assist with destruction mechanics!

#### Examples

**Placement Scenario 1:** Canned cans on a cupboard shelf. Logically, the only
*parent* here is the cupboard. Destroy it – everything inside it wil be
destroyed. It turns out that the cans lie on top of each other and they are not
*parents*. If we shoot the bottom can – the top one will remain hanging in the
air.

<img src="_images/composit_blk_09.jpg" alt="Placement Scenario 1" align="center" width="50em">

**Placement Scenario 2:** On top of the closet are individual *non-parent*
objects: an upside-down shoebox lid, the shoe box itself inside the shoe box lid
and a shoe inside that shoe box. According to the rules this is incorrect,
because you can try and shoot the lid from under the box, and the box from under
the shoe. But here the thicknesses and dimensions are so small that this can be
neglected. This is an acceptable violation that in most cases will never be
noticed.

<img src="_images/composit_blk_10.jpg" alt="Placement Scenario 2" align="center" width="50em">

**Placement Scenario 3:** The issue has already been resolved, so here is an old
screenshot that doesn't quite capture the correct angle. In the center, we can
observe a typical problem where the *child* object (a basin) hasn't been
properly aligned with its *parent* (a wardrobe), which at this point has already
been destroyed. However, our focus here is on the arrangement to the right – the
artistic stacking of basins on top of the wardrobe. It looks impressive, but it
will be 100% noticeable when the lower basins start getting destroyed before the
upper ones.

<img src="_images/composit_blk_11.jpg" alt="Placement Scenario 3" align="center" width="50em">

```{important}
**Summary:**

1. Avoid stacking objects on top of each other without clearly defining which is
   the *parent* and which is the *child*.

2. *Child* objects should only be placed on their *parent* in a single layer.
   Any objects that do not collide with the *parent's* bounding box will not be
   destroyed correctly.

3. If you need to create a complex composition that cannot be achieved with the
   current setup due to these limitations, request permission to create a unique
   rendering composition that will break apart using a destruction mechanism.
```

### Hierarchy of Composites

#### Problems with Poor Hierarchy

A common issue when creating composites is that all objects are often placed
within a single large composite. The rationale behind this approach is
understandable – it's easier to arrange everything in one scene, export it, and
forget about it.

However, the problem is that work with composites never truly ends there. Errors
are inevitable, and revisions are guaranteed. At some point, these revisions
will occur directly in the composite's `.blk` file, not in the original scene
where everything was initially arranged. Once this happens, the original scene
becomes obsolete, and all work shifts to the `.blk` file.

This can lead to significant issues. For example, consider a composite:

<img src="_images/composit_blk_12.jpg" alt="Interior" align="center" width="50em">

Imagine that every object here is not part of a subcomposite but is instead
manually placed within this composite (for the sake of example, though this is
not actually the case).

Let's examine the typical problems that might arise using this setup. Take this
cabinet with vases:

<img src="_images/composit_blk_13.jpg" alt="Cabinet with vases" align="center" width="20em">

Notice that it's placed in several locations:

<img src="_images/composit_blk_14.jpg" alt="Cabinet with vases at several places" align="center" width="50em">

The designer, seeking efficiency, may simply copy and paste the entire setup
elsewhere in the scene. The result is identical arrangements throughout the
house, with perhaps one or two vases changed to give the illusion of randomness.

We've previously discussed chain destruction. Now, imagine you didn't quite
align one of the vases with the cabinet, and it ends up hanging in the air when
the cabinet below is destroyed.

This introduces several problems:

- Remember, this setup has been copied across multiple locations in the house.
- Some vases may also be standing independently, scattered on the floor, for
  instance.

You'll need to painstakingly search through the composite, identify each vase,
and adjust their positions individually.

Now, consider needing to place this cabinet with vases outside, with the
landscape involved. Either the vases will clip through the cabinet, or they'll
float above it while the cabinet sits on the ground.

Procedural rotations and shifts are nearly impossible in such a scenario. Keep
in mind that these adjustments often can't be automated and need to be manually
tweaked after tools like *daEditor* or *dag2riRes*. In a large composite, this
becomes utterly impractical.

Additionally, performing simple randomization, such as swapping one cabinet for
another, becomes highly inconvenient. You'll have to sift through hundreds of
lines.

The root cause of these problems is the unreadability of the composite. It's
nearly impossible to quickly make any adjustments in such a tangled mess. In
extreme cases, an entire house's furnishings (minus the house itself) might be
crammed into a single composite, like this:

<img src="_images/composit_blk_15.jpg" alt="Entire house's furniture" align="center" width="50em">

Typically, we don't assign tasks to "create a composite for a single house."
More often, the tasks involve "creating 15 houses with full furnishings,"
handled by 5-8 different team members. Each person ends up spending an enormous
amount of time individually setting up unique render instances for their houses,
instead of leveraging low-level random composites created by a dedicated team
member—a method that could save everyone hours of work.

It's understandable that every artist wants to create something unique, perhaps
to tell a story or guide the player towards a specific thought, like "this is
where the homeowner loved to admire their favorite vase on this cabinet." But no
one will notice these details because in an online shooter the environment needs
to:

- Fit seamlessly into the overall scene;
- Not interfere with gameplay.

What players will notice is a poorly placed object that disrupts their aim due
to collision issues. You will notice the massive headache when you try to find
that object in a composite with hundreds of lines. And your colleagues will
notice the time wasted on manually arranging objects instead of using pre-made
sets.

```{important}
**Summary of Problems**

- Uncontrolled propagation of errors.
- Inability to align object groups with terrain.
- Lack of variety.
- Excessive time spent manually adding variety to the scene.
- Unreadable composite files, making it extremely difficult to understand what
  is located where and what it controls.
- Inability to reuse composites, preventing the use of ready-made asset groups
  in neighboring houses.
```

To avoid these issues, it's crucial to adhere to strict composite hierarchy
rules.

#### Proper Hierarchy

The hierarchy of composites should be broken down to the smallest procedural
modification of an object. Let's use the example of vases and cabinets:

1. **Create composites for each small procedural modification of an object:**

   - Procedural rotations/shifts (e.g., rotating vases around their axis).
   - Object randomization (e.g., swapping cabinets or vases for similar ones).

2. **From the composites created in step 1, build composites for object
   groups.**
   - Create several variations of vases arranged on a cabinet.
   - Combine these variations into a single random composite like "random vase
     arrangement on cabinet".

3. **From the composites created in step 2, create a random composite for
   "cabinets with random vase arrangements".**

4. **From the composites created in step 3, assemble a composite for furnishing
   a large object, such as "random cabinets with vases placed around the
   object".**

5. **Finally, include the composite from step 3 in the overall "house"
   composite, along with similar composites for "windows-doors", "exterior
   decor", "interior decor", etc.**

```{note}
Unfortunately, there is no universal composite structure – it all depends on
what you're creating. If you need a random composite for a single cabinet, you
might only need one level of hierarchy – a random composite for that cabinet,
where you can specify shifts, rotations, and randomization.

But if you're creating a furniture and dishware store, you may need 3-6 levels
of composite hierarchy.

The key is to start with the lowest level of composites and work your way up
step by step. This approach ensures everything remains as editable and fixable
as possible. You'll be able to resolve any placement issues across all game maps
by simply tweaking a few numbers in one small, unobtrusive file.
```

## Nuances about Composites

### Additional Notes on Naming Conventions

As previously mentioned multiple times throughout this chapter, including at the
beginning, let's clarify a few key points:

1. **Composites vs. Render Instances:** Unlike render instances, composites
   don't take up space in the game client (they simply aren't included).
   Therefore, it's not a significant issue if you copy successful composites
   from other maps and rename them for your own purposes. This approach helps
   you avoid potential problems if the original composite's creator decides to
   modify it, which could disrupt your setup.

2. **Detailed Naming:** Always name composites as descriptively as possible,
   including all relevant prefixes and suffixes designated for both composites
   and render instances. This is crucial because, for example, you might create
   a composite intended for interior use but fail to include the `is_` prefix. A
   colleague might then mistakenly use it outdoors and add landscape alignment,
   causing the composite to sink into the ground in all your buildings.

3. **Proper Use of Composites:** Those placing existing composites should also
   pay close attention to their intended use. If a composite is clearly marked
   for interior use, **do not** place it outside. Instead, duplicate it, give it
   a new name, and avoid any issues.

4. **Random Composites:** If the composite involves randomization, include the
   numbers of the randomized objects in the name. For example,
   `is_table_abc_random.composit.blk`.

5. **Content Ownership:** Clearly indicate the thematic ownership of a composite
   in its name. For instance, if you're creating a composite of ancient vases,
   name it accordingly so that colleagues don't unknowingly place it in a
   futuristic setting.

### Object Placement on Terrain and Relative to Each Other

You might have noticed that when exporting composites from the editor, they
often include an additional parameter, `place_type:i=1`, in the nodes. For
example:

```text
node{
  name:t="fachwerk_horse_cart_a_cmp"
  tm:m=[[0.999018, 0, -0.0443057] [0, 1, 0] [0.0443057, 0, 0.999018] [-6.7688, 0.0028134, -1.22241]]
  place_type:i=1
}
node{
  name:t="haystack_i"
  tm:m=[[0.020657, 0, 0.999787] [0, 1, 0] [-0.999787, 0, 0.020657] [6.92909, 0, -1.47888]]
  place_type:i=3
}
```

These values can range from 1 to 6 (or potentially even higher).

This occurs because you exported objects that were placed on the terrain
according to specific rules.

<img src="_images/composit_blk_16.jpg" alt="Object properties" align="center" width="20em">

**Placement Types:**

- **place pivot: `place_type:i=1:`** Vertical placement of the object's pivot on
  the terrain (pivot in Dagger is at 0.0.0). Suitable for large, tall objects
  that extend deep into the ground (buildings, poles, large piles of
  debris)—essentially anything unaffected by terrain height variations.

  <img src="_images/composit_blk_17.jpg" alt="place_type:i=1" align="center" width="20em">

- **place pivot and use normal: `place_type:i=2:`** Placement of the pivot on the
  terrain, using the normal at the pivot point (if the terrain is uneven, the
  object will tilt according to the normal). Best for smaller items that need to
  conform to the terrain's shape (e.g., barrels, buckets, bicycles, cans). Large
  objects might not align correctly if their pivot is on the edge of a slope,
  causing part of the object to float in the air. Use this only for small
  assets.

  <img src="_images/composit_blk_18.jpg" alt="place_type:i=2" align="center" width="20em">

- **place 3-point (bbox): `place_type:i=3:`** Placement using three points of the
  object's bounding box. The bounding box is built based on the object's maximum
  geometry limits, and the object is placed on the ground at three of its
  extreme points, accounting for terrain height variations. This method is more
  precise than type 2 but slightly more demanding on the editor. It's needed for
  large objects that must conform to terrain undulations (e.g., haystacks, piles
  of boards, ladders, carts, vehicles).

  <img src="_images/composit_blk_19.jpg" alt="place_type:i=3" align="center" width="20em">

  ```{note}
  If the object extends below zero (e.g., piles, foundations), it may be pushed
  up because the placement is based on the bounding box, which is built on the
  outermost geometry points. For such objects, use types 1 or 2.
  ```

- **place foundation (bbox): `place_type:i=4:`** Vertical placement on the
  terrain so that the entire base of the bounding box is **not above** the
  terrain. The object may partially extend below the terrain but will never
  float above it.

  <img src="_images/composit_blk_20.jpg" alt="place_type:i=4" align="center" width="20em">

- **place on water (floatable): `place_type:i=5:`** Vertical placement on a water
  plane (yes, water has a plane).

  <img src="_images/composit_blk_21.jpg" alt="place_type:i=5" align="center" width="20em">

- **place pivot with rendInst collision: `place_type:i=6:`** Vertical placement
  of the render instance's pivot on the collision of another render instance.

  <img src="_images/composit_blk_22.jpg" alt="place_type:i=6" align="center" width="20em">

  Works well on simple objects:

  <img src="_images/composit_blk_23.jpg" alt="place_type:i=6" align="center" width="20em">

  but struggles with complex ones as it may not correctly identify the collision
  surface:

  <img src="_images/composit_blk_24.jpg" alt="place_type:i=6" align="center" width="40em">

```{important}
When exporting composites from the
[daEditor](../../dagor-tools/daeditor/daeditor/daeditor.md), ensure you set the
placement types for each component of the future composite (e.g., every barrel,
bucket, and vehicle).

When exporting composites from a *ds Max scene, manually assign these
parameters to the appropriate objects in the final composite.

Do not export composites without these parameters and then apply them to the
entire composite afterward (e.g., setting the entire exterior decoration
composite of a house to `place_type:i=3`). This often leads to bugs, as it's
unclear what is used as the pivot or bounding box.

Always assign the correct placement types to the objects intended for them.
```

## Object Placement Precision

In any game, objects are placed on a grid according to their pivot point (recall
that the pivot for Dagger is at 0.0.0). This means that objects cannot be placed
with greater precision than the smallest unit allowed by the grid, which we can
refer to as the *Dagger millimeter*.

As a result, objects placed in non-zero positions will align perfectly only when
the composite has no rotation or offset.

For instance, a house with DP (dynamic positioning) components will remain
perfectly aligned regardless of rotation or displacement because both the
house's base and its DP components are exported relative to zero at the correct
positions. They are exported this way to ensure optimal placement.

However, objects like windows, doors, or paintings that are hung on walls made
of debris or bricks may "drift" when the composite is rotated or moved,
especially paintings. But don't worry.

In War Thunder, the placement grid isn't precise enough for this to cause
significant issues – we have large margins for error. In daNetGame-based games,
this "drifting" only happens in the [Asset
Viewer](../../dagor-tools/asset-viewer/asset-viewer/asset_viewer.md) and
[daEditor](../../dagor-tools/daeditor/daeditor/daeditor.md). When the location
is exported, a much higher level of precision is used than in the tools, so
objects generally align correctly. While you should check the final placement,
you don't need to worry that it will be "just as bad" as it appears in the
[daEditor](../../dagor-tools/daeditor/daeditor/daeditor.md).

### Examples

- **Editor View**:

  <img src="_images/composit_blk_25.jpg" alt="Editor view" align="center" width="50em">

- **In-Game View:**

  <img src="_images/composit_blk_26.jpg" alt="In-game view" align="center" width="50em">

### Special Parameters

Composites have several parameters designed for specific, limited-use cases.

#### War Thunder

The `quantizeTm:b=yes` parameter should be applied outside the nodes
(immediately after the line `className:t="composit"`) when combining the
geometry of a render instance with the collision of a prefab in a composite.

These object types have different positioning precision on the map (prefabs are
less precise). Additionally, prefabs have even less precision when it comes to
rotation. Therefore, when combining these two objects, the collision almost
always fails to align with the visual geometry.

This parameter forces the prefab to align exactly with the coordinates of the
render instance.

```text
className:t="composit"
quantizeTm:b=yes
node{
  tm:m=[[1, 0, 0] [0, 1, 0] [0, 0, 1] [0, 0, 0]]
  node{
    name:t="sheer_cliff_a"
    tm:m=[[1, 0, 0] [0, 1, 0] [0, 0, 1] [0, 0, 0]]
  }
  node{
    name:t="sheer_cliff_a_prefab_collision:prefab"
    tm:m=[[1, 0, 0] [0, 1, 0] [0, 0, 1] [0, 0, 0]]
  }
}
```

#### daNetGame-based Games

**Random Object Seeds**: In daNetGame-based game, all objects within a
composite, for example, share the same color scheme. This means you won't find a
house with windows and doors of varying colors – the colors differ as you move
across the map, but each house's windows and doors will always share a uniform
color.

This is intentional – each composite is assigned exactly one seed (a randomly
chosen value, essentially). This seed is applied from the top-level composite
down to the most nested object.

This approach has pros and cons. For instance, all the furniture, toys, and
dishes inside a house will be uniformly colored. This makes it impossible to
create something like a fabric shop, where you'd expect fabrics of different
colors, because all the fabrics will share one color. Similarly, identical
furniture items will show the same level of wear.

This can be addressed using the `ignoreParentInstSeed:b=yes` parameter, which is
applied to the specific object (or composite) that should have a different seed
from the parent composite.

For example, if you want each piece of fabric in a store to have a different
color, you need to apply this seed to **each fabric node** within the composite,
not to the overall "arranged fabrics" composite. Otherwise, the entire composite
will have a different seed, but the objects within it will share a single seed.

**Correct Example**: The shoe and its box will have different seeds and
therefore different colors.

```text
node{
  name:t="is_high_heel_shoe_a"
  ignoreParentInstSeed:b=yes
  tm:m=[[0.0888685, 0.939605, 0.205868] [0.49344, -0.244331, 0.902145] [0.896062, 0.0213662, -0.484326] [-2.40811, 1.9364, -31.9424]]
}
node{
  name:t="is_high_heel_shoebox_a_opened"
  ignoreParentInstSeed:b=yes
  tm:m=[[0.0765914, 0, -0.997063] [0, 1, 0] [0.997063, 0, 0.0765914] [-4.67105, 2.93796, -24.8412]]
}
```

**Incorrect Example**: Although the entire composite of items will have a
different seed from the main composite, all items within it will share the same
seed.

```text
node{
  name:t="city_1_department_store_shops_stuff_cmp"
  ignoreParentInstSeed:b=yes
  tm:m=[[1, 0, 0] [0, 1, 0] [0, 0, 1] [0, 0, 0]]
}
```
```{important}
**Summary**

Apply this parameter to specific render instances or composites that need to
have a different seed from the main composite.

**Do not** apply it to the entire composite expecting everything inside to
become randomized – it won't. All nested objects will still share a common seed,
even if it differs from the main composite's seed.
```

### Checklist

Before considering composites as finished, you should verify the following:

- **Correct display of the composite object in [Asset
  Viewer](../../dagor-tools/asset-viewer/asset-viewer/asset_viewer.md)**: Ensure
  nothing is misplaced or missing, and everything appears as intended.

- **Correct generation of variable objects using the "Generate Random Seed"
  button in the right panel**: Check that nothing overlaps or disappears
  unexpectedly, and no extra objects are loaded.

- **No errors in the Asset Viewer log**: Monitor the console for red error lines
  related to asset display issues in the composite due to incorrect naming,
  missing textures, or other unfinished work.

  The composite log typically only indicates that an object isn't displaying.
  You'll need to open the problematic object itself to see what the log says
  about it.

## Creating a Standard Composite Object

Having discussed the structure and theory behind composite objects, let's now
delve into the actual creation process. There are several methods available for
creating a composite object, each with its own advantages and disadvantages:

- [**Manual Creation**](#manual-creation)
- [**Using the daEditor**](#using-the-daeditor)
- [**Using the dag2riRes Script**](#using-the-dag2rires-script)
- [**Using the Composite Editor in Asset Viewer**](#using-the-composite-editor-in-asset-viewer)
- [**Using the dag4blend Add-on in Blender**](#using-the-dag4blend-add-on-in-blender)
- [**Creating Random Composites in 3ds Max**](#creating-random-composites-in-3ds-max)

### Manual Creation

There isn't much to elaborate on here. You simply create a file with the
extension `.composit.blk` and manually define a series of nodes, specifying the
object names and their coordinates.

This method is only practical when you need to add parts of a single object
without any offsets, such as the walls of a house, its indoor furnishings,
decals, decor, and ground (everything being geometry or subcomposites centered
at the house's "zero" point).

**Pros:**

- All composite object parameters are accessible in a single text file.
- No need for the original scene file; you only need a new or existing
  `.composit.blk` file.

**Cons:**

- **Blind Work:** You can't see the result while working, making it challenging
  to align objects correctly.
- **Matrix Definitions:** Manually defining matrices is virtually impossible –
  let the computer handle that.

This method is typically used as part of a pipeline to refine non-random
composite objects generated by other means.

### Using the daEditor

This method is simple:

1. Place the necessary objects in the
   [daEditor](../../dagor-tools/daeditor/daeditor/daeditor.md) as desired.
2. Select the objects, starting with the central one (which will later become
   the composite's center).
3. In the **Landscape** tab, select the **Export as Composit** option:

   <img src="_images/composit_blk_27.jpg" alt="Using daEditor" align="center" width="30em">

**Pros:**

- Easy to apply.
- Unlike the manual method, it simplifies editing object transforms – matrices
  are automatically calculated.

**Cons:**

- **Composite Center:** You can't control the composite's center. When selecting
  multiple objects with a frame, it's impossible to predict which one will
  become the "zero" point. When selecting objects sequentially, the first
  selected object becomes the "zero" coordinate, which isn't always convenient.
  You can't set a center outside of an object.
- **Random Transformations:** Only fixed matrices and specific assets are
  allowed; you can't set random transformations or objects.

A workaround is to add an additional object at the desired center, start
selecting from it, and then delete this placeholder after exporting the final
composite. However, this isn't particularly convenient.

This method is typically used to create simple object sets (e.g., piles of
debris, rows of barrels, log stacks). Adding randomness requires further
refinement by other methods.

### Using the dag2riRes Script

Using the [dag2riRes](../../dagor-tools/dag2rires/dag2rires.md) script is
another relatively simple method. While the description may seem complex, after
trying it out, the steps will become logical and clear, requiring minimal effort
from the developer. The key is to follow the steps in order, as missing one will
force you to start over.

The idea behind this method is to assemble the composite from objects in 3ds
Max, export them as a `.dag` file, and then use the script to convert `.dag`
into `.composit.blk`. The script also allows you to split all objects exported
into one `.dag` file into individual `.dag` files.

**Pros:**

- **Real-Time Preview:** Move nodes directly in the viewport with instant
  feedback.
- **Snapping Option:** Allows for more precise placement of objects if needed.

**Cons:**

- **No Randomization:** You can't define random transformations or entities.
- **No Include Statements:** Unable to include general transformations.

**Workflow:**

1. Import all the base Levels of Details (LODs) of models into one scene that
   you plan to use in the composite.
2. Attach each model into a single object (if they were split across multiple
   objects in their scenes).
3. Name each model as its corresponding `.dag` file, minus the `.lod00.dag`
   suffix (e.g., if the DAG is `table_a.lod00.dag`, name the model `table_a`).
4. Reset the model's pivot to `0.0.0`, and zero out rotation and scale. Failing
   to do so will result in incorrect matrix calculations in the final composite
   (non-zeroed parameters will affect the matrices).
   - For example, if the pivot isn't at `0.0.0` but remains a meter along the
     X-axis, the model will shift that distance in the composite.
5. Assign a three-digit postfix to each object: `*_000` (e.g., `table_a` becomes
   `table_a_000`).
   - When cloning, ensure the three-digit postfix remains intact: `table_a_001`,
     `table_a_002`, etc.
6. The object that will serve as the composite's center should have the postfix
   `*_origin` instead of `_000` (e.g., `table_origin`).
7. Position the objects as desired, cloning them within the scene as references
   or instances. Ensure the rotation, position, and scale match your intended
   adjustments.
8. Export the final layout as a single `.dag` into the directory with the
   [dag2riRes](../../dagor-tools/dag2rires/dag2rires.md) script. It's easier to
   keep the DAG name consistent to avoid confusion later.
9. Run the script, which will generate a `composit.res.blk` file alongside the
   `.dag` (more details below).
10. Rename and move the `composit.res.blk` file to the desired location. Ensure
    the composite name is correct – refer to the beginning of the document for
    naming conventions.

```{important}
If several nodes in the 3ds Max scene are linked into a hierarchy before export,
the script will treat the entire hierarchy as a single node named after the root
object.
```

**Running the [dag2riRes](../../dagor-tools/dag2rires/dag2rires.md) Script**

1. Open FAR or the command line.
2. Navigate to the `_Dag2riRes/` directory.
3. Enter the following command:

   ```text
   dag2riRes-dev.exe -s:<name.dag> -d:simple_dags -no_tex
   ```

   where `<name.dag>` is your `.dag` file's name. You can assign any name.

**Naming Reminder:** make sure to name the final composite correctly! Not just
the name but also the postfixes.

- `*_cmp.composit.blk`: Simple composite object.
- `*_random.composit.blk`: Composite object with randomization (object
  substitution, object disappearance).
- `*_gameobj.composit.blk`: Composite object containing game objects.

### Using the Composite Editor in Asset Viewer

Using the [Composite Editor in Asset
Viewer](../../dagor-tools/asset-viewer/asset-viewer-comp-editor/asset_viewer_comp_editor.md)
is a relatively new option, still under development, so some basic features
might be missing at the time of writing and will be added over time.

**Pros:**

- **Highly Visual:** You can see the results of your work in real-time in the
  viewport.
- **Works with `.composit.blk`:** Allows editing existing composites without
  needing the original 3ds Max scene.
- **Randomization:** Nodes can be created with random entity selection.
- **Transform Randomization:** Nodes can be created with random transforms.

**Cons:**

- **In Development:** Performance issues when editing large composites
  (thousands of nodes), especially noticeable in daNetGame-based games due to
  frequent use of multiple nested structures.
- **No Multi-Node Selection:** Can only move nodes one by one.
- **No Undo:** If you move a node and change your mind, you must either manually
  revert it or reload from disk, losing all unsaved changes.
- **Limited Gizmo:** Only available in world coordinates – can't move an asset
  along one of its own axes in the viewport.
- **No Include Support:** Currently, there is no support for `include`
  statements.
- **Interface Development:** Some elements might not be intuitive.

In addition to adding `includes`, it allows you to fully create a hierarchy of
composites.

### Using the dag4blend Add-on in Blender

[dag4blend Composite
Editor](../../dagor-tools/addons/blender/dag4blend-comp-editor/dag4blend_comp_editor.md)
is a part of the
[dag4blend](../../dagor-tools/addons/blender/dag4blend/dag4blend.md) add-on,
which was previously a simple importer-exporter. It's a new option, also under
development.

**Pros:**

- **Composite Import:** You can import composites without needing the original
  `.blend` scene. All you need is the `.composit.blk` file and the asset `.dag`
  files (applicable only to the version with geometry import).
- **High Visual Clarity:** The workflow is highly visual, making it easier to
  see and manage your changes.
- **Convenient Workflow:** Features like snapping, multi-node selection, and
  more make it significantly easier to work with, similar to the ease of use in
  3ds Max.
- **Random Entity Nodes:** You can directly create nodes that include random
  entity selection.
- **Random Transform Nodes:** You can directly create nodes with randomized
  transforms.
- **Subcomposite Editing:** You can decompose and edit any subcomposite at its
  final position within the parent composite, allowing you to see the exact
  final node placements.
- **Composite-to-DAG Conversion:** Offers the ability to convert composites into
  `.dag` files.
- **Game Object Conversion:** Allows converting `gameObj` nodes into meshes and
  converting a mesh's bounding box into a `gameObj` node, which simplifies the
  placement of elements like indoor walls, wall holes, environmental probes,
  etc.

**Cons:**

- **No Include Support:** Currently, there is no support for `include`
  statements.
- **Limited Random Node Preview:** The visibility of entities within random
  nodes must be manually toggled; they are not randomized automatically.
- **Game Object Preview:** The preview for `gameObj`s must be manually
  configured; otherwise, they appear as empty nodes.
- **No Random Transform Preview:** There is no preview available for randomized
  transforms.
- **Axis Confusion:** [Blender uses the Z-axis as the upward
  direction](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/scene_layout/object/editing/transform/control/axis_locking.html),
  whereas the Dagor Engine uses the Y-axis. This difference must be considered
  when defining parameters for random transforms.

### Creating Random Composites in 3ds Max

When planning to use random objects in nodes, it's best to prepare for this in
advance, during the composite assembly in 3ds Max. This is crucial to avoid
randomization issues later. If you skip this step, you might find a chair
clipping through a table, or a table through a dresser in the final composite.

For instance, suppose you want to create a random composite of chairs placed
around a table, with the chairs being of different sizes and shapes. You would
combine them into one object and name it after the final random composite (e.g.,
`chairs_abc_random` for a composite named `chairs_abc_random.composit.blk`).

You should use this combined geometry during placement to see the boundaries of
the objects that will be randomized in the node.

To configure the randomization itself, further refinement of the composite by
other methods is necessary.
