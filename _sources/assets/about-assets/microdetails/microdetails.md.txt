# Microdetails

## About Microdetails

Microdetails are fine-detail textures, such as skin pores, wood grain veins,
grains of sand, and moss leaves. They are used to add extra detail to both
unique textures on objects and tiling textures.

Currently, microdetails are employed in two main project areas:

- War Thunder-based projects
- daNetGame-based projects

## Microdetails in War Thunder

### Technology

Microdetails for assets are no longer sourced from `levelname.blk`, but are
instead retrieved from a separate list located at
`<project_name>/develop/gameBase/config/_assetsMicroDetails.blk`.

```{eval-rst}
.. table::
   :widths: auto
   :align: center

   =====  =======================================
   Index  Entity
   =====  =======================================
   0      ``microdetail_stone_a_tex_n``
   1      ``microdetail_scan_gravel_a_tex_n``
   2      ``microdetail_sand_a_tex_n``
   3      ``microdetail_soil_a_tex_n``
   4      ``microdetail_generic_granules_a_tex_n``
   5      ``microdetail_grass_a_tex_n``
   6      ``microdetail_forest_floor_a_tex_n``
   7      ``microdetail_fabric_a_tex_n``
   8      ``microdetail_wood_b_tex_n``
   9      ``microdetail_metal_a_tex_n``
   10     ``microdetail_snow_a_tex_n``
   11     ``microdetail_generic_granules_a_tex_n``
   12     ``microdetail_concrete_b_tex_n``
   =====  =======================================
```

If a particular microdetail is missing, such as `concrete`, you can add it to
the list as entries 12, 13, 14, and so on, without any limit. These indices are
determined by their order in the list.

#### Microdetails for Terrain

The technology for terrain microdetails incorporates a "layered" approach: from
the stone base layer up to the top moss layer. This method is known as the
"layer cake" system, which looks like this:

```{eval-rst}
.. table::
   :widths: auto
   :align: center

   =====  ========================================  ==================
   Index  Entity                                    Color in R-Channel
   =====  ========================================  ==================
   0      Stone                                     0
   1      Small stones (gravel)                     23
   2      Sand                                      46
   3      Soil (or snow)                            69
   4      Unique for map 1 (often ice)              93
   5      Grass                                     116
   6      Moss/leaves                               139
   7      Unique for map 2                          162
   8      Unique for assets 1 (often wood)          186
   9      Unique for assets 2 (often liquid/metal)  209
   10     Unique for assets 3 (often noise)         232
   11     Unique for assets 4 (often granules)      255
   =====  ========================================  ==================
```

Microdetails appear on terrain according to their corresponding entities. For
example, grass microdetails appear on grass, stone microdetails on stone, and
sand on sand.

This is controlled by the "color in the R-channel", effectively acting as an
index for the microdetails stored in the B-channel of the texture.

- On each map, level designers can also specify a general scale for the
  microdetails.
- This is set in the `level.blk` file and typically appears in the following
  format:

```text
micro_details{
  micro_detail:t=microdetail_stone_a_tex_n
  micro_detail:t=microdetail_scan_gravel_a_tex_n
  micro_detail:t=microdetail_sand_a_tex_n
  micro_detail:t=microdetail_soil_a_tex_n
  micro_detail:t=microdetail_generic_granules_a_tex_n
  micro_detail:t=microdetail_grass_a_tex_n
  micro_detail:t=microdetail_forest_floor_a_tex_n
  micro_detail:t=microdetail_generic_granules_a_tex_n

  micro_detail:t=microdetail_wood_a_tex_n
  micro_detail:t=microdetail_liquid_a_tex_n
  micro_detail:t=microdetail_snow_a_tex_n
  micro_detail:t=microdetail_generic_granules_a_tex_n

  land_micro_details_uv_scale:r=0.51
}
```

```{important}
There are two types of `level.blk` files:

1. Files ending in `.level.blk`, such as `avg_berlin.level.blk`.
2. Files located in `<project_name>/develop/gameBase/levels` that do not end
   with `.level.blk`, such as `avg_berlin.blk`.

For microdetail configuration, you should refer to the second type.

If you're working in the SDK, the files you need can be found in
`C:\WarThunder\WarThunderCDK\levels`, such as `empty_location.blk`.
```

### Enabling Microdetails in Tools

Because microdetails vary between maps, they will display correctly in the
[daEditor](../../../dagor-tools/daeditor/daeditor/index.rst) (as it opens the
maps). However, in [Asset
Viewer](../../../dagor-tools/asset-viewer/asset-viewer/index.rst), microdetails
must be enabled manually.

If the guides for Asset Viewer or daEditor aren't sufficient, select the
appropriate `level.blk` for your map in the Asset Viewer's sun tool:

```{eval-rst}
.. image:: _images/microdetails_01.jpg
   :alt: Level BLK selection
   :width: 30em
   :align: center
```

```{important}
By default, microdetails are disabled in *Asset Viewer*, and assets using them
will appear black. To resolve this, ensure the correct `level.blk` is loaded.
```

## Microdetails in daNetGame-based Projects

The system in daNetGame-based projects is similar to War Thunder but with key
differences.

1. Microdetails on terrain function similarly but are not applied to assets.
2. On assets, character-specific microdetails are used and are not part of the
   "layer cake" system.

   ```{eval-rst}
   .. table::
      :widths: auto
      :align: center

      =====  ======================
      Index  Entity
      =====  ======================
      0      Fine noise
      1      Fabric
      2      Coarse fabric (burlap)
      3      Felt
      4      Knitted wool
      5      Leather
      6      Metal
      7      Wood
      =====  ======================
   ```

3. There are no issues with applying these microdetails: simply use the ones
   that fit your needs. They remain consistent.
4. For this reason, no manual configuration is necessary in the tools:
   microdetails are always active.

```{note}
In addition to standard character microdetails, you can also add custom
microdetails, provided there is enough texture memory available.
```

These microdetails can also be used for `rendinst` object types. The only
limitation is that their size must be 256x256, which matches the size of the
older microdetail textures. Pre-existing textures are usually found in
`<project_name>/develop/assets/common/textures/character_microdetails`.

To add your new textures, include them in the following file:
`<project_name>/develop/gameBase/config/character_micro_details.blk`.

Add a line like this in the `character_micro_details{}` block:

```text
micro_detail:t=your_texture_name_tex_n*
```

```{important}
When testing new textures in Asset Viewer, remember that changes to textures
will not update automatically. After making any changes, you must reload Asset
Viewer to see the latest results.
```

## Shader Settings

Different types of objects and shaders have their own specific configurations.
In most cases, these settings are consistent across projects, with only rare
exceptions (which will be discussed separately).

### Shader: `simple_aces`/[`rendinst_simple`](../../shaders/dng-shaders/rendinst_simple.md) for Rendinst and `simple_aces` for Prefabs (or `dynamic_masked_chrome_bump` for Destrs)

This shader uses the first UV channel for mapping. Since the UV layout is
usually unique, two issues may arise:

1. Seams may appear on the model due to unstitched UV shells.
2. Microdetails may appear stretched along one axis, as microdetail textures are
   always square, while the object's texture may be rectangular.

The following three parameters are used for configuration:

- `script:t="micro_detail_layer=11"`: Where `11` is the microdetail layer index,
  ranging from `0` to `11`.
- `script:t="micro_detail_layer_uv_scale=75.17"`: Defines the tiling of the
  microdetail. A higher value results in a finer pattern.
- `script:t="micro_detail_layer_v_scale=0.5"`: Scales the microdetail along the
  vertical axis, addressing the issue of rectangular UV mapping on the asset.

### Shader: [`rendinst_perlin_layered`](../../shaders/rendinst_perlin_layered.md) for Rendinst (or `dynamic_perlin_layered` for Destrs)

The configuration is similar to
[`rendinst_simple`](../../shaders/dng-shaders/rendinst_simple.md).

### Shader: [`rendinst_layered`](../../shaders/rendinst_layered.md) for Rendinst

Microdetails are applied to material tiles that use the third UV channel. This
channel is typically procedural with stitched UV shells, preventing the issues
seen in the `simple_aces` shader.

The following four parameters are used for configuration:

- `script:t="micro_detail_layer1=0"`: Microdetail index for detail layer 1. The
  default value is `-1`, which disables it.
- `script:t="micro_detail_layer2=3"`: Microdetail index for detail layer 2. The
  default value is `-1`, which disables it.
- `script:t="micro_detail_layer1_uv_scale=5.17"`: Tiling of microdetail layer 1.
  A higher value results in a finer pattern.
- `script:t="micro_detail_layer2_uv_scale=5.13"`: Tiling of microdetail layer 2.
  A higher value results in a finer pattern.

### Shader: layered_static for Prefabs

This shader differs slightly from
[`rendinst_layered`](../../shaders/rendinst_layered.md), but microdetail
configuration is done in the same way (see above).

### Shader: [`land_mesh_height_decal`](../../shaders/dng-shaders/land_mesh_height_decal.md) for Decals

Decals derive their microdetails from the terrain they are applied to. However,
there are a few additional settings:

- `script:t="write_vtexmask=4095"`
- `script:t="alpha_gamma=0.2,0.01,1,1"`

1. The `write_vtexmask` parameter specifies which channels of the virtual
   texture should not be written to.

   - The first 4 bits (1111) correspond to the diffuse (RGB) + alpha.
   - The second 4 bits (1111) correspond to the normal (RG) + microdetail (B) +
     alpha.
   - The third 4 bits (1111) correspond to AO (R), translucency (G), smoothness
     (B), and alpha.

   In binary, each decimal value has a corresponding binary representation:

   - r = 1 = `1`
   - g = 2 = `10`
   - b = 4 = `100`
   - a = 8 = `1000`

   **Example:**

   - `write_vtexmask=15`: `(1+2+4+8)` writes only the diffuse and alpha (1111
     0000 0000).
   - `write_vtexmask=240`: `(1+2+4+8)*16` writes only the normal, microdetail,
     and alpha (0000 1111 0000).
   - `write_vtexmask=176`: `(1+2+8)*16` writes only the normal and alpha (0000
     1101 0000).
   - `write_vtexmask=3248`: `(1+2+8)*16 + (4+8)*256` writes only normal+alpha
     and smoothness+alpha (0000 1101 0011).
   - `write_vtexmask=4095`: `(15+15*16+15*256)` writes everything (default, no
     need to specify).

   You can calculate these values using a programmer's calculator. Enter the
   bits you want to write, as described in the examples above. Keep in mind that
   the calculator displays bits in reverse order, but the sequence described
   here remains consistent.

   **Examples:**

   1. To write only the diffuse + alpha, use the first 4 bits (`1111`), convert
      to binary, and then to decimal – which equals `15`.

      ```{eval-rst}
      .. only:: html

         .. grid:: 1
            :class-container: center-grid

            .. grid-item::
               :class: center-cell
               :child-direction: row
               :child-align: center

                   :align: center

              - .. figure:: _images/microdetails_03.jpg
                   :align: center
      ```

   2. To write only normal, microdetail, and alpha, the first 4 bits (diffuse+A)
      are all zeros, and the second 4 bits are all ones.

      ```{eval-rst}
      .. only:: html

         .. grid:: 1
            :class-container: center-grid

            .. grid-item::
               :class: center-cell
               :child-direction: row
               :child-align: center

               .. image:: _images/microdetails_04.jpg
                  :alt: Binary format
                  :height: 15em
                  :class: image-gap

               .. image:: _images/microdetails_05.jpg
                  :alt: Decimal format
                  :height: 15em

      .. only:: latex

         .. list-table::
            :widths: 50 50
            :align: center

            * - .. figure:: _images/microdetails_04.jpg
                   :align: center

              - .. figure:: _images/microdetails_05.jpg
                   :align: center
      ```

   3. To write only normal and smoothness, the first 4 bits (diffuse+A) are
      `0000`, the second 4 bits are `1101` (normal+alpha without microdetail),
      and the third 4 bits are `0011` (smoothness+alpha without AO and
      translucency).

      ```{eval-rst}
      .. only:: html

         .. grid:: 1
            :class-container: center-grid

            .. grid-item::
               :class: center-cell
               :child-direction: row
               :child-align: center

               .. image:: _images/microdetails_06.jpg
                  :alt: Binary format
                  :height: 15em
                  :class: image-gap

               .. image:: _images/microdetails_07.jpg
                  :alt: Decimal format
                  :height: 15em

      .. only:: latex

         .. list-table::
            :widths: 50 50
            :align: center

            * - .. figure:: _images/microdetails_06.jpg
                   :align: center

              - .. figure:: _images/microdetails_07.jpg
                   :align: center
      ```

2. The `alpha_gamma` parameter adjusts the strength of various decal attributes.
   By default, it's set to `alpha_gamma = 1,1,1,1`.

   - First value: Diffuse
   - Second value: Normal and microdetail
   - Third value: Smoothness, AO, and translucency
   - Fourth value: Displacement

   Each value represents a gamma (power) function. Lower values increase the
   intensity of the parameter they affect.

   For example, `alpha_gamma = 1,0.01,1,1` makes the normal and microdetail very
   sharp (`alpha 0.5` becomes `0.5^0.01 = 0.993`). Conversely, `alpha_gamma =
   8,1,1,1` makes the diffuse very faint (`0.5^8 = 0.004`).

## Microdetail Configuration in daNetGame-based Projects

### Rotating Microdetails by 90 Degrees

In daNetGame-based projects, there's an option to rotate the microdetail
orientation by 90 degrees, useful when the asset's UV mapping is incorrect. The
rotation can only be applied at 90-degree increments.

Use the parameter `script:t="micro_detail_layer_swap_uv=1"` to achieve this.

For all rendinst shaders that use microdetails, this parameter swaps the U and V
coordinates during microdetail application.

- `0`: Default, no changes to coordinates.
- `1`: Swaps the U and V coordinates, effectively rotating the microdetail by 90
  degrees.

This works in all prop shaders within daNetGame-based projects.

### Adjusting Microdetail Intensity

In daNetGame-based projects, you can also adjust the intensity of microdetails.

The parameter `script:t="micro_detail_layer_intensity=1"` allows control over
intensity, with a range from `0` to infinity (the default value is `1`).
