# Procedural Rendinst Painting

## Overview

This article provides a general overview of procedural painting, its principles,
and various types. Detailed shader configuration is covered individually [for
each shader](#shader-parameter-list).

We use different types of procedural painting across various projects, mainly
due to the migration of technologies between projects and the development of new
methods.

In War Thunder-based projects, we have:

1. [Procedural texture painting](#procedural-texture-painting-all-projects).
2. [Painting the second
   detail](#procedural-painting-of-second-detail-in-daeditor-war-thunder) of the
   [`rendinst_layered`](../../shaders/rendinst_layered.md) shader via the editor
   (now deprecated).

In daNetGame-based projects, we have:

1. [Procedural texture painting](#procedural-texture-painting-all-projects).
2. [Procedural parameter-based
   painting](#procedural-painting-with-parameter-danetgame-based-projects).

## Procedural Texture Painting: All Projects

### Workflow

This is the most common painting method. We use a special texture (or multiple
textures), where each pixel row vertically corresponds to a paint line that will
color an object. You can fill an entire row with a single color (for uniformly
painting an object) or use multiple colors, which will change the object's color
based on its position on the map.

General steps for using a paint map:

1. Obtain a paint texture, for example, an image.

   ```{eval-rst}
   .. image:: _images/procedural_rendinst_painting_01.jpg
      :alt: Paint texture
      :width: 55em
      :align: center
   ```

2. Select an existing row with appropriate colors or create a new row with the
   required colors. Rows are indexed from **zero**, meaning the first row is
   `0`, not `1`.
3. Specify the selected row number in the shader.
4. Optionally, define the painting strength (if the shader supports it).

The result is an asset painted in the desired color. If the row contains
multiple colors, the object will display different colors depending on its
position on the map.

```{eval-rst}
.. image:: _images/procedural_rendinst_painting_02.jpg
   :alt: Asset in the desired color
   :width: 55em
   :align: center
```

```{important}
When creating a new paint line, ensure it is not already in use! Update the
texture and use the nearest available row, or if possible, reserve unused rows
by filling them with a noticeable bright color and labeling the asset for which
they are reserved.

Failure to do so may result in a paint conflict (someone else might use your row
before you do, leading to your assets appearing in unwanted colors, forcing you
to reconfigure multiple shaders), along with other complications.
```

### Technical Details

1. The global paint palette across all projects is uniformly named
   `assets_color_global_tex_palette.tif`. Naming conventions for other palettes
   follow the pattern: `map_name_color_tex_palette.tif`. For example: for the
   War Thunder map `air_stalingrad`, the texture would be named
   `air_stalingrad_color_tex_palette.tif`.

   Unfortunately, the current naming of painting textures does not fully comply
   with this convention, and they are named inconsistently. Please adhere to
   these naming rules when creating new paint textures.

2. The paint line is selected in the shader by specifying the row. The column
   within that row is determined by the object's position on the map.
   Essentially, a random pixel in the row is chosen as the object moves across
   the landscape.

   ```{eval-rst}
   .. image:: _images/procedural_rendinst_painting_03.jpg
      :alt: Selected paint line
      :width: 55em
      :align: center
   ```

   Consequently, the more frequently the colors change within the row, the more
   frequently the object's color will change as it moves on the map.

3. There may be instances where you need to define a strict combination of
   procedural colors on an asset. For example, construction cranes might require
   different parts to be painted in specific color combinations, or vehicles
   might need predetermined color schemes for the roof and body.

   This is achieved by following the same logic as in point 1: the colors across
   all paint lines are selected from a single column of pixels, based on the
   object's position on the map.

   ```{eval-rst}
   .. image:: _images/procedural_rendinst_painting_04.jpg
      :alt: Different color combinations
      :width: 55em
      :align: center
   ```

   Therefore, you should define multiple rows for the asset, one for each part
   that will be painted separately. Group the color combinations as needed. As a
   result, you'll always get the correct color combinations on the selected
   asset.

   ```{eval-rst}
   .. image:: _images/procedural_rendinst_painting_05.jpg
      :alt: Construction cranes in different color combinations
      :width: 55em
      :align: center
   ```

### War Thunder Specifics

#### Painting Behavior

1. Painting is applied based on a paint mask, which is the alpha channel of the
   diffuse map. White areas will be painted, while black areas will not.
2. The color is applied as a modulation (a multiply operation, doubled).

#### Paint Textures

1. There are several paint textures in use:

   - The global paint texture, `assets_color_global_tex_palette.tif`, is used to
     paint anything that can be reused across multiple maps. Typically, this
     includes everything except buildings, which may need to be repainted
     differently for each map.

   - Local paint textures are created for specific maps as needed. For example,
     a test texture was created for the `air_stalingrad` map, named
     `air_stalingrad_color_tex_palette.tif`. These are used to repaint specific
     objects on specific maps.

   All textures are stored in this location:
   `<project_name>/develop/assets/textures/colorize_textures/`, in 24-bit TIF
   format (without alpha).

2. You can assign a specific texture to an asset for painting by using the
   parameter `script:t="palette_index="`.
   - Value `0` means the asset will always be painted using the global palette.
   - Value `1` (default) means the asset will be painted using the local
     palette.

   ```{important}
   In War Thunder, local palettes (map-specific) are optional and may not be
   specified. If an asset does not have a specified palette index, it will be
   painted using the palette for the map it is located on. If no specific
   palette is assigned to the map, all assets will be painted using the global
   palette.

   In contrast, in daNetGame-based projects, if no palette is specified for an
   asset, it will not be painted at all, and a palette must always be explicitly
   assigned.
   ```

3. Since this technology was introduced to War Thunder relatively late,
   thousands of objects were left without a defined paint palette (i.e., they
   lack the `script:t="palette_index="` parameter). As a result, when we want to
   repaint a specific asset on a specific map, we duplicate the global palette
   and modify (or add) paint lines for the specific asset, leaving everything
   else unchanged.

   For example, `assets_color_global_tex_palette.tif` and
   `avg_iberian_castle_color_tex_palette.tif` differ only in row 168
   (disregarding new rows added to the global palette after the fact).

4. The width of the paint texture is 64 pixels. The height is a power of two,
   such as 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and so on. Only the RGB channels are used.

#### Adding Local Paint Textures to Maps

Local paint textures are assigned to levels via the `level.blk` file, for
example: `<project_name>/develop/gameBase/levels/stalingrad.blk`. The syntax is
as follows:

```text
shader_vars{
  paint_details_tex:t="air_stalingrad_color_tex_palette"
}
```

#### Painting Assets in Composites

It is not possible to apply uniform painting to identical objects within a
composite (e.g., windows in a building). If multiple colors are present in a
paint row, they will be applied randomly.

This makes it challenging to paint large composite objects (such as skyscrapers
composed of multiple vertical segments), especially if the segments are shifted
in the composite to create buildings of varying heights. Each segment may end up
with inconsistent colors.

### daNetGame-Based Projects Specifics

#### Painting Behavior

1. In daNetGame-based projects, painting is applied directly to the diffuse
   texture without using any masks. Instead, daNetGame-based project's shaders
   use black and white paint point parameters. This approach avoids overloading
   the shaders with mask-based painting, as is done in War Thunder.

   - The black point defines the brightness of the albedo texture at which no
     painting will be applied.
   - The white point defines the brightness at which the albedo texture will be
     fully painted.

   This allows you to specify a brightness range that will be painted, while
   excluding other areas (such as dark streaks in wood). If you need to exclude
   brighter areas from being painted, you can invert the paint point values
   (i.e., set the black point higher than the white point).

   ```{eval-rst}

   .. important::

      A common mistake when using paint points is setting the same values for both
      the black and white points.

      **Examples:**

      .. code-block:: text

         script:t="paint_points_black=1,0.75,0.2,0"
         script:t="paint_points_white=1,0.75,0.2,0"

      .. code-block:: text

         paint_white_point=0.2
         paint_black_point=0.2

      .. code-block:: text

         script:t="paint_points=0.5,0.5,1,1"

      These configurations will result in a division by zero error, which
      generates the following message:

      .. code-block:: text

         rendinst_perlin_layered: divide by zero[real] while exec shader code. stopped at operand #45

      Therefore, **never set the same values for both paint points**.

      From this, two potentially error-prone situations arise:

      1. **Only one detail is being painted, and it requires paint points**.
         What about the other details and points?

         **Solution**: For the second (or third) detail, set any range of paint
         points. You can use the default `0,1`, as this detail is not being
         painted. The key is to avoid using identical values for the points.

         **Example:**

         .. code-block:: text

            script:t="paint_details=0,1,0,0"
            script:t="paint_points=0,1,0.12,0.23"

      2. **Two or three details are being painted, but only one or two need
         paint points** (i.e., more details are being painted than require paint
         points).

         **Solution**: For the painted details that do not need paint points,
         assign the maximum range: `0,0.00001`.

         **Example:**

         .. code-block:: text

            script:t="paint_details=1,1,0,0"
            script:t="paint_points=0,0.00001,0.12,0.23"
   ```

2. In most cases, the color is applied using a simple multiplication.

   An exception is
   [`rendinst_simple_painted`](../../shaders/dng-shaders/rendinst_simple_painted.md),
   which has a parameter `paint_mult=1`, where `1` is a regular multiplier, and
   `2` is a 2x multiplier.

#### Paint Textures

1. There are several paint textures:

   - The global paint texture, `assets_color_global_tex_palette.tif`, is used to
     paint anything that can be reused across multiple maps. It is located at:
     `<project_name>/develop/assets/manmade_common/textures/palettes/assets_color_global_tex_palette.tif`.

   - Local paint textures are created for specific maps to repaint particular
     objects (most commonly, building parts). The following rules were
     established:
     - Row 0 is reserved for painting building walls.
     - Row 1 is for doors and windows.
     - Beyond that, you can assign colors freely.

     Local paint textures should be placed in the appropriate map directories.
     For example:
     `<project_name>/develop/assets/battle_of_moscow/textures/palettes/volokolamsk_building_colors_tex_palette.tif`.

     ```{note}
     Unfortunately, not all textures are currently stored in these paths, and
     some are located in other directories, which is somewhat illogical.

     Please ensure that textures are placed in the correct locations when
     creating new ones.
     ```

2. You can assign a paint texture to an asset using the parameter
   `script:t="palette_index="`.
   - Value `0` means the asset will always be painted using the global palette.
   - Value `1` (default) means the asset will be painted using the local
     palette.

   In most cases, the value should be set to `0`. Only building walls and their
   windows and doors typically remain set to `1` (or have no value specified).

3. The width of the paint texture is 256 pixels. The height is a power of two,
   such as 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, etc. Only the RGB channels are used.

#### Connecting Local Paint Textures to Maps

1. Local paint textures are integrated into scene `.blk` files. For example, for
   daNetGame-based projects, the scene files are located in:
   `<project_name>/prog/gameBase/content/<project_name>/gamedata/scenes/`

   The syntax is as follows (the `*` after the texture name is mandatory):

   ```text
   entity{
     _template:t="shaderVars"

     "shader_vars__vars:object"{
       paint_details_tex:t="sovmod_building_colors_tex_palette*"
     }
   }
   ```

#### Painting Assets in Composite Objects

Unlike in War Thunder, in daNetGame-based, all identical objects within
composite objects are automatically painted with the same color, even if
multiple colors are available in the paint row. For example, the windows and
doors of a building won't be randomly colored red, blue, or green. They will all
be painted the same color throughout the building.

However, this can sometimes be inconvenient, such as in shops, where all
identical assets like books, toys, or buckets would have the same color. To
introduce more variety, you can use the parameter `ignoreParentInstSeed:b=yes`.
This is applied to the final node of the composite object, allowing that
particular node to be painted with a unique color.

**Example:**

```text
node{
  type:t="rendInst"
  name:t="tunis_city_house_window_1200x1900_a_cmp"
  tm:m=[[-1, 0, -1.50996e-07] [0, 1, 0] [1.50996e-07, 0, -1] [-1.07798, 7.54841, 4.72492]]
  ignoreParentInstSeed:b=yes
}
```

```{important}
The parameter must be applied to the final node: the specific object that you
want to paint separately from other objects in the composite. For instance, if
you apply this to the composite object `house_a_plates`, the entire composite
will be painted separately from other composite objects of **House A**, but the
plates will all still have the same color.

Therefore, if you need the individual plates themselves to be painted different
colors, you must set the parameter on each individual plate within the composite
`house_a_plates`.
```

#### Painting Assets on Water or Floating on Waves

For assets that are located on water, such as the `yacht_azimut62E` on
`avn_san_francisco`, you must specify the parameter `script:t="use_painting=2"`,
or you will encounter issues as shown in this video:

## Procedural Painting of Second Detail in daEditor: War Thunder

This is an outdated War Thunder technology, but it still exists. It is only used
on [`rendinst_layered`](../../shaders/rendinst_layered.md), and is described in
this article.

## Procedural Painting with Parameter: daNetGame-based Projects

In some shaders (e.g.,
[`rendinst_simple_painted`](../../shaders/dng-shaders/rendinst_simple_painted.md),
[`rendinst_perlin_layered`](../../shaders/rendinst_perlin_layered.md)), there is
a parameter `script:t="paint_const_color=0,0,0,0"` (or `detail_const_color`, if
multiple details are involved in blending).

- The first three components represent the RGB color (convert values from
- `0`-`255` to `0`-`1`).
- The fourth component controls the intensity of the color's effect on the
  model's albedo. A value of `0` means no effect, and `1` means full influence,
  with a gradient in between.

  However, this does not work perfectly; a value of `0` still leaves some
  influence from the paint, albeit faintly. There is little point in leaving
  this parameter unused.

The parameter works both on its own and in combination with texture painting
(the fourth component will define the strength of the texture painting
influence).

### Shader Parameter List

#### War Thunder

- `script:t="palette_index=0"`: global parameter that defines the global
  painting texture.
  - `0`: global texture;
  - `1`: (default), local texture of the specific map.

For shaders with diffuse/normal maps:

- `script:t="use_painting=1"`: controls painting from the palette specified in
  the scene shader variables.
  - `1`: enables painting, `0`: disables it.
  - Values between `0.01` and `0.9` control the painting strength (as a
    multiplier). Painting is applied according to the alpha of the diffuse map,
    multiplied by the `use_painting` value.
  - Values between `1.01` and `1.9` also influence the painting strength,
    ranging from `0.0` to `1.0`, but they disable the random pixel selection
    from the paint line based on object height shifts (useful for painting modular
    skyscrapers in a consistent color).

    The palette itself is named `paint_colors.dds` and is located here:
    `<project_name>/develop/assets/textures/colorize_textures`.

- `script:t="painting_line=43"`: specifies the paint line number (indexing
  starts at `0`).

For [`rendinst_layered`](../../shaders/rendinst_layered.md)/`dynamic_layered`
and their derivatives:

- `script:t="use_painting=1"`
- `script:t="painting_line=43"`
- `script:t="paint1stdetail=1"`: an additional parameter indicating which detail
  to paint.
  - `1`: for the first detail,
  - `0` (or `-1`): for the second.

For
[`rendinst_perlin_layered`](../../shaders/rendinst_perlin_layered.md)/`dynamic_perlin_layered`:

- `script:t="paint_details=0,1,0,0"`:
  - The first 2-3 components (depending on the number of details) select which
    details are painted. Values range from `0` to `1`. Experimenting with
    negative or values above `1` is possible, but requires caution.
  - The 4th component specifies the paint line (index starts at `0`).

#### daNetGame-based Projects

- `script:t="palette_index=0"`: a global parameter that defines the global
  painting texture.
  - `0`: global texture;
  - `1`: default, local texture of the specific map.

For
[`rendinst_simple_painted`](../../shaders/dng-shaders/rendinst_simple_painted.md):

- `paint_palette_row=1`: where `1` is the paint line number from the texture.
  By default, the shader uses line 1 (in this case, the parameter can be
  omitted).
- `paint_white_point=0.2`: the diffuse brightness at which the albedo will be
  fully painted.
- `paint_black_point=0.05`: the diffuse brightness at which the albedo will not
  be painted.
- `paint_mult=1` (or `2`): where `1` applies no multiplier, and `2` applies a 2x
  multiplier.

For [`rendinst_layered`](../../shaders/rendinst_layered.md)/`dynamic_layered`
and their derivatives:

- `script:t="use_painting=1"`
- `script:t="painting_line=43"`
- `script:t="paint1stdetail=1"`

For shaders with detail mixing, excluding
[`rendinst_layered`](../../shaders/rendinst_layered.md):

- `script:t="paint_details=0,1,0,0"`:
  - The first 2-3 components (depending on the number of details) select which
    details are painted. Values range from `0` to `1`. Experimenting with
    negative or values above `1` is possible, but should be done carefully.
  - The 4th component specifies the paint line (index starts at `0`).

- `script:t="paint_points=0,0,0,0"`: parameter for setting paint points for two
  details, analogous to the black/white point behavior in
  [`rendinst_simple_painted`](../../shaders/dng-shaders/rendinst_simple_painted.md).
  The first two components define the paint points for the first detail, and the
  last two components for the second.

Alternatively:

- `script:t="paint_points_black=0,0,0,0"`: sets the black point for three
  details. The first three components set the black point for each detail, and
  the 4th component must be present but is unused.
- `script:t="paint_points_white=1,1,1,0"`" –" sets the white point for three
  details. The first three components set the white point for each detail, and
  the 4th component must be present but is unused.
