# `dynamic_painted_by_mask`

## Overview

A dynamic shader designed for vehicles in *daNetGame*-based projects.

## Textures

- **tex0**: Diffuse albedo
- **tex2**: Normals + metalness + smoothness
- **tex4**: Grayscale paint mask (white = 100% paint coverage, black = no paint)
- **tex5**: Optional grayscale camouflage mask (white = painted with the second
  color, black = no paint)

## Parameters

- `script:t="primary_color=0,0,0,0"` – Defines the primary paint color based on
  the mask from **tex4**. The first three values represent the RGB color; the
  fourth value is unused.

- `script:t="secondary_color=0,0,0,0"` – Defines the secondary paint color based
  on the mask from **tex5**. The first three values represent the RGB color; the
  fourth value is unused.

## Functionality

If only one mask and one color are specified, the shader will apply the paint
based on that mask. For example:

<img src="_images/dynamic_painted_by_mask_01.jpg" width="50%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

When both masks and two colors are provided, the shader can generate camouflage
patterns in any color combination. For example:

<img src="_images/dynamic_painted_by_mask_02.jpg" width="50%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

The color defined in the asset will be applied to all vehicles of this type
unless it is overridden in the templates.

Predefined color sets and random color generation in-game are configured in
`.blk` files located in:
`<project_name>/prog/gameBase/content/<project_name>/gamedata/templates/`.

For example, predefined color sets:

```
vehicle_color_smoking_red value:p4=0.6, 0.105, 0.117, 1.0
vehicle_color_vampire_red value:p4=0.419, 0.039, 0.074, 1.0
vehicle_color_canyon_copper value:p4=0.807, 0.341, 0.184, 1.0
```

The following block indicates that there is a 90% chance the vehicle will be
painted in one of the four specified colors:

```
ar_painting.chance:r=0.9
"car_painting.possibleColors:array"{
  "item:object"{ color:t="vehicle_color_battleship_gray"; }
  "item:object"{ color:t="vehicle_color_dark_gray"; }
  "item:object"{ color:t="vehicle_color_thundercloud"; }
  "item:object"{ color:t="vehicle_color_military_green"; }
}
```
