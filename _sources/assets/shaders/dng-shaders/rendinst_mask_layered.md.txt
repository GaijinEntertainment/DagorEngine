# `rendinst_mask_layered`

## Overview

The `rendinst_mask_layered` shader is designed for rendering instances using two
detail tiles, a global normal map, and an overlay texture (applied using
`modulate2x`). The details are blended according to their respective heightmaps
and a blending mask provided in the overlay texture.

The primary distinction between this shader and
[rendinst_layered](../rendinst_layered.md) is that `rendinst_mask_layered` uses
only a single UV channel.

**Parameters:**

- `script:t="detail_tile=7.1"` – Controls the tiling of both detail maps
  simultaneously. Applies to both details.
- `script:t="invert_height1=1"` – (default – `0`) – Inverts the heightmap of
  Detail1. This can be a fractional value (e.g., `0.5` makes the heightmap
  gray).
- `script:t="invert_height2=1"` – (default is `0`) – Inverts the heightmap of
  Detail2 map. This can also be a fractional value.
- `script:t="paint_details=0,0,0,0"` – Configures the coloring of the two
  details.
- `script:t="paint_points=0,1,0,1"` – Sets the black and white points for the
  coloring range of both details.
- `script:t="atest=1"` – Enables alpha test.
- `script:t="details_alphatest=0,0.15,0.45,0"` – Specifies which detail to
  apply alpha test on and with what intensity.
- `microdetails` – This shader supports the standard syntax used in the
  [rendinst_simple](./rendinst_simple.md) or
  [rendinst_perlin_layered](../rendinst_perlin_layered.md) shaders.
- `heightmap blending`– For more information on heightmap blending, refer to
  [Blending with Landscape
  Heightmap](../rendinst_layered.md#blending-with-landscape-heightmap).

## Material Structure

- **Slot 1: Overlay Texture**
  The overlay texture is applied over other textures using `modulate2x`.
  - **RGB Channels:** Albedo
  - **Alpha Channel:** Blending mask for the details, similar to
    [rendinst_layered](../rendinst_layered.md).
    - White pixel: Detail2 (upper)
    - Black pixel: Detail1 (lower)
    - Gray pixel: Displays the detail with the higher heightmap value at that
      location.

  ```{important}
  If an overlay is created without a blending mask, it defaults to 100% black.
  As a result, all further material adjustments will be nearly invisible because
  only Detail1 will be displayed (black in the mask reveals Detail1).
  ```

- **Slot 2: Unused**

- **Slot 3: Global Normal Texture**
  This texture is placed beneath the detail normals, modifying them.
  - **RG Channels:** Normal map
  - **B Channel:** Not used, should remain black.
  - **Alpha Channel:** Smoothness, applied using `modulate2x` over the details'
    smoothness.

  ```{important}
  Avoid adding unnecessary smoothness to the global normal unless:
  1. You’re emphasizing specific elements in the overlay, such as adding dirty
  leaks and configuring their smoothness on the normal's alpha.
  2. You need to differentiate materials within the same detail, like making car
  paint matte while keeping the bumper glossy.
  3. The texture is not used uniquely, such as when part of the overlay and
  global normal is shared with the [rendinst_simple](./rendinst_simple.md)
  shader for elements like headlights or glass.

  A common issue is adding smoothness to the global normal, which can override
  the details' smoothness, leaving only the most prominent details visible.
  Unused areas of the global smoothness should remain 50% gray.
  ```

- **Slots 4-5: Detail1 Textures**
  - Slot 4: Diffuse texture for Detail1.
  - Slot 5: Normal texture for Detail1.

- **Slots 6-7: Detail2 Textures**
  - Slot 6: Diffuse texture for Detail2.
  - Slot 7: Normal texture for Detail2.

## Parameters

- `script:t="detail_tile=7.1"` – Controls the tiling of both detail maps
  simultaneously.
- `script:t="invert_height1=1"` – (default – 0) – Inverts the heightmap of
  Detail1.
- `script:t="invert_height2=1"` – (default – 0) – Inverts the heightmap of
  Detail2.

  ```{important}
  Unlike the [rendinst_perlin_layered](../rendinst_perlin_layered.md) shader,
  heightmap inversion parameters in `rendinst_mask_layered` do not affect the
  overall distribution of details. Instead, details are distributed across the
  model using the blending mask (overlay alpha). Heightmap inversion highlights
  specific features within those details.

  If the heightmap is not inverted, white (high) pixels take priority. For
  example, intact sections of chipped stucco will be visible (as they are
  higher). If the heightmap is inverted, the damaged sections will become
  prominent (as they are higher after inversion).
  ```

- `script:t="paint_details=0,0,0,0"` – Configures the coloring of the two
  details (the overlay is not colored).
  - First component: Colors Detail1 (non-integer values can specify intensity).
  - Second component: Colors Detail2 (non-integer values can specify intensity).
  - Third component: Not used but must be included for the shader to function
    correctly.
  - Fourth component: Selects the row for coloring.

-  `script:t="paint_points=0,1,0,1"` – Sets the black and white points for the
  coloring range of both detail maps.
  - First component: Black point for Detail1, similar to
    [rendinst_simple_painted](./rendinst_simple_painted.md).
  - Second component: White point for Detail1.
  - Third component: Black point for Detail2.
  - Fourth component: White point for Detail2.

  ```{important}
  Always specify different values for the black and white points, even if the
  detail is not being colored. The default configuration should be

  `script:t="paint_points=0,1,0,1"`.

  Failure to do so may result in identical black and white points, causing a
  division by zero error:

  `rendinst_mask_layered: divide by zero [real] while executing shader code. Stopped at operand #45`.
  ```

  This allows you to define a color range for materials with distinct brightness
  variations, such as painted wood. You can adjust the black and white points to
  control the color change in the paint layer while keeping the wood layer
  beneath either unchanged or minimally altered.

- `script:t="atest=1"` + `script:t="details_alphatest=0,0.15,0.45,0"`:

  The `atest` and `details_alphatest` parameters must be used together to enable
  and configure alpha test:
  - `script:t="atest=1"` – Enables alpha test.
  - `script:t="details_alphatest=0,0.15,0.45,0"` – Specifies which detail to
    apply alpha test on and with what intensity.

- **Microdetails** function the same as in the
  [rendinst_perlin_layered](../rendinst_perlin_layered.md) shader.
