# Shader Family: `land_mesh_combined_decal`

## Overview

We use several shaders for object geometry to apply decals to the terrain. This
is not to be confused with simple ground decals, which apply directly to the
terrain geometry – that's a different topic. Here, we are dealing with
**geometric decals**.

When do we need to apply a decal to the terrain using geometry? When we want to
modify the landscape's geometry and add some new color (and possibly details). A
good example would be airfields. Given their large size, it's impractical to
render them as full-scale models with unique textures (or tiled textures), as
this would result in a poor texel density. Moreover, they wouldn't blend
seamlessly with the surrounding terrain – there would be harsh transitions
between textures.

The solution is decals. For example, if you want a snowy airfield in a desert,
you can achieve this with decals. All decals are prefabs – they are baked into
the level's geometry.

There are several shaders we can use for this:

1. `land_mesh_combined` and its dynamic version `dynamic_combined_decal`
2. `land_mesh_combined_detailed_decal` and its dynamic version
   `dynamic_combined_detailed_decal`
3. `land_mesh_combined_mixed_decal` and its dynamic version
   `dynamic_combined_mixed_decal`

```{important}
The difference between dynamic and static shaders boils down to two key points:
- Static shaders are applied to prefabs, while dynamic shaders are applied to
  dynamic models (for simplicity, think of them as models with dynamic shaders).
- Objects with dynamic shaders can only be placed through the *MissionEditor* as
  units (whether they're part of an object group or a dynamic object). In
  contrast, static objects are placed directly as entities in the **Landscape**
  tab.
```

## Basic Shader: `land_mesh_combined`/`dynamic_combined_decal`

This is the simplest shader in the family. It has no parameters and applies only
a decal texture to the geometry. The typical material configuration looks like
this:

```
material{
  name:t="airfield_side"
  class:t="land_mesh_combined"
  tex0:t="./norway_herdla_airfield_empty_alpha.tif"
}
```

The decal texture represents the diffuse component of what we are applying. The
alpha channel controls the transparency of the decal.

For example:

<table style="text-align:center; width:98%"><thead><tr>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:30%"><p>Airfield on the Map</p></th>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:33%"><p>Decal Diffuse</p></th>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:33%"><p>Decal Alpha</p></th></tr></thead>
</table>

<img src="_images/land_mesh_combined_decal_04.jpg" width="33%" class="bg-primary">

Currently, this basic shader is rarely used because the need for greater detail,
even for aircraft-related assets, has increased. However, it's sometimes applied
to the "manchette" of airfields (the curved edges used to blend the airfield
surface with the surrounding terrain). In such cases, the shader with a
transparent alpha texture is assigned to this geometry:

## Shader with One Detail Layer: `land_mesh_combined_detailed_decal`/`dynamic_combined_detailed_decal`

This shader works with three textures:

- **Slot 1:** decal texture with transparency in the alpha channel.
- **Slot 2:** diffuse detail texture.
- **Slot 3:** `_r` detail texture.

The first two slots are self-explanatory. The `_r` texture requires further
reading, but in short, it contains a height map, microdetail index, smoothness,
and reflectance. Based on these parameters, the detail on the terrain is
embossed and exhibits the physical properties of the desired material.

```{important}
This `_r` texture is not the same as the one used for landscapes! On landscapes,
the `_r` texture includes reflectance, ambient occlusion, microdetail index, and
smoothness.
```

This shader has the following parameters:

- `script:t="detail1_size_ofs=0.25,0.25,0,0"` – this offsets the detail texture
  (effectively controlling the tiling).

A typical material configuration looks like this:

```
material{
  name:t="smolensk_aero_south"
  class:t="land_mesh_combined_detailed_decal"
  script:t="detail1_size_ofs=64,32,0,0"
  tex0:t="smolensk_aero_south_tex.tif"
  tex1:t="detail_soil_cracked_tex_d.tif"
  tex2:t="detail_soil_cracked_tex_r.tif"
}
```

The logic is the same as in `land_mesh_combined`, except that this shader adds a
detail layer to the decal texture. Essentially, in this case, the decal acts
more as an overlay because of its large texel size, which results in a blurred
appearance.

<img src="_images/land_mesh_combined_decal_07.jpg" width="48.5%" class="bg-primary">

The fine details come from the detail and microdetail textures. For instance,
fine textures such as small cracks or wear patterns are handled by the detail
layers, while larger surface elements, like ruts or pathways, are represented by
the decal.

## Shader with Four Detail Layers: `land_mesh_combined_mixed_decal`/`dynamic_combined_mixed_decal`

This is the most advanced shader in the family. It operates similarly to
`land_mesh_combined_detailed_decal` but supports up to four detail layers
instead of one.

```{important}
There's a known issue: if an object has mapping in the third channel, its
texture on the ground may appear semi-transparent. Avoid using unnecessary
mapping channels.
```

```{important}
The dynamic version is not suitable for large surfaces (hundreds of meters) made
of dense materials (concrete, asphalt, etc.), as it becomes semi-transparent
when viewed from a distance. For example, you might notice that the markings and
runway seem to fade when seen from far away.

```

### Shader Textures

The shader works with 10 textures:

- **Slot 1:** decal
- **Slot 2:** detail blending mask
- **Slot 4:** diffuse texture for detail layer 1
- **Slot 5:** `_r` texture for detail layer 1
- **Slot 6:** diffuse texture for detail layer 2
- **Slot 7:** `_r` texture for detail layer 2
- **Slot 8:** diffuse texture for detail layer 3
- **Slot 9:** `_r` texture for detail layer 3
- **Slot 10:** diffuse texture for detail layer 4
- **Slot 11:** `_r` texture for detail layer 4

The blending mask is an RGB mask where:
- R-channel represents detail layer 1
- G-channel represents detail layer 2
- B-channel represents detail layer 3
- Areas with less than 100% brightness in all channels will display detail layer
  4.

```{note}
Don't worry if the fourth detail layer appears in areas without detail layers 1,
2, or 3. The final decal's visibility is controlled by the decal's alpha
transparency, meaning you can control the appearance of all details, including
the fourth layer, using the transparency mask.
```

For example:

<table style="text-align:center; width:98%"><tr>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:45%"><p>Airfield on the Map</p></th>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:53%"><p>Decal Diffuse</p></th></tr>
</table>

<img src="_images/land_mesh_combined_decal_02.jpg" width="45%" class="bg-primary">
<img src="_images/land_mesh_combined_decal_03.jpg" width="53%" class="bg-primary">

<table style="text-align:center; width:98%"><tr>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:49%"><p>Decal Alpha</p></th>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:49%"><p>Blending Mask</p></th></tr>
</table>

<img src="_images/land_mesh_combined_decal_04.jpg" width="49%" class="bg-primary">
<img src="_images/land_mesh_combined_decal_09.jpg" width="49%" class="bg-primary">

In this case:
- The blue channel defines the pathways.
- The alpha mask smooths the edges of other detail layers, making them
  transparent and revealing the fourth layer.
- All channels together create a multicolored effect on the runway, blending
  different types of sand, dirt, and rocks.

Some examples use more defined masks:

<table style="text-align:center; width:98%"><tr>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:42%"><p>Airfield on the Map</p></th>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:56%"><p>Decal Diffuse</p></th></tr>
</table>

<img src="_images/land_mesh_combined_decal_10.jpg" width="42%" class="bg-primary">
<img src="_images/land_mesh_combined_decal_11.jpg" width="56%" class="bg-primary">

<table style="text-align:center; width:98%"><tr>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:49%"><p>Decal Alpha</p></th>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:49%"><p>Blending Mask</p></th></tr>
</table>

<img src="_images/land_mesh_combined_decal_12.jpg" width="49%" class="bg-primary">
<img src="_images/land_mesh_combined_decal_13.jpg" width="49%" class="bg-primary">

<img src="_images/land_mesh_combined_decal_14.jpg" width="75%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

In this case:
- R-channel represents concrete.
- G-channel represents concrete slabs.
- B-channel represents dirt.
- A-channel (black in the mask) represents dirt paths and dust along the edges
  of the concrete and slabs.

All these elements appear based on the decal's alpha transparency.
