# `rendinst_layered`

## Overview

This shader is used for objects where we want to apply multiple material
textures (e.g., brick and stucco tiles that are stored in different textures).

It can work with both tiles and unique textures. However, its primary purpose is
for using tiles – it allows objects to be created without visible tiling,
without the need for unique textures.

The shader uses the following types of textures:

- **UV1**: Global normal map – the normal map for the entire object.
- **UV3**: Details (detail textures) with normal maps and speculars – 2 tiling
  material textures.
- **UV2**: Overlay map – applies effects of leaks/wear and tear to the
  unwrapped parts of objects, over the detail textures (tiles).
- **UV2**: Exclusion mask – globally indicates where certain materials should
  appear on the object.
- **UV2**: Blending mask – allows to randomize the blending of detail textures
  with the exclusion mask across the model, resulting in diverse appearances of
  the object using the same textures.

Let's take a closer look.

## Textures

### Texture Assignment

For more details, see [here](./rendinst_layered.md#texture-assignment-1).

### Global Normal Map

This is straightforward. For most simple objects (fences, bollards, sometimes
houses), a standard normal map from our libraries is used. For more complex
objects, unique normal maps are created.

Their main purpose is to smooth out edges and chamfers. Since the objects
themselves will be covered with material tiles (which contain their own normal
maps), it's important to achieve smoothing on the global normal map for those
aspects that the tile normal maps cannot smooth out.

```{important}
Do not create the texture details of the object's materials on this texture.
Only smooth out seams, worn edges, etc.
```

<table style="text-align:center; width:98%"><tr>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:49%"><p>Without a global normal map</p></th>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:49%"><p>With a normal map showing chamfers</p></th></tr>
</table>

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_01.jpg" width="49%" class="bg-primary">
<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_02.jpg" width="49%" class="bg-primary">

The global normal map uses **UV1**. No other texture uses this UV channel.

### Detail Textures (Details)

Let's illustrate the concept using a brick house covered with stucco.

**There are always two details!**

- **Detail1** represents the material the object is made of. For instance, if
  the house wall is made of bricks, then Detail1 would be bricks.
- **Detail2** represents the material covering the object (such as moss on a
  tree or dirt on a cobblestone). For the house wall covered in stucco, Detail2
  would be the stucco.

In this example, we use `modern_brick_brown_dirt_d.tif` and
`stucco_new_d.tif`, along with their respective normal maps, which contain
corresponding specular maps in their alpha channels.

<table style="text-align:center; width:98%"><tr>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:49%"><p>1st map - Dirty Brickwork</p></th>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:49%"><p>2nd map - Fresh Stucco</p></th></tr>
</table>

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_03.jpg" width="49%" class="bg-primary">
<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_04.jpg" width="49%" class="bg-primary">

In general, the process is straightforward, with one exception – we need to
blend these textures automatically on the model. To achieve this, we use the
alpha channel of the diffuse maps, which contains heightmaps: the lighter the
pixel, the "heavier" it is. The material with the higher heightmap at any given
point will dominate in that texel.

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_05.jpg" width="49%" class="bg-primary">
<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_06.jpg" width="49%" class="bg-primary">

By blending these two heightmaps in the shader, we achieve a non-uniform texture
appearance: in some areas, the brickwork is visible because its heightmap is
higher, while in others, the stucco dominates. For example:

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_07.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

What happens if we modify these heightmaps? Suppose we want the stucco to cover
the entire brick surface completely. To do this, we need to eliminate all the
light pixels in the brick's heightmap, as these are the areas where the brick
shows through the stucco.

<table style="text-align:center; width:98%"><tr>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:43%"><p>Making the heightmap entirely black:</p></th>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:55%"><p>Results in:</p></th></tr>
</table>

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_08.jpg" width="43%" class="bg-primary">
<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_09.jpg" width="55%" class="bg-primary">

```{important}
Of course, this approach isn't advisable – this was merely a demonstration of
how heightmaps work. These maps are essential for creating a seamless,
non-repeating overlay of stucco on top of the bricks.
```

**Details use UV3 mapping**, typically mapped using a 3x3x3 meter box without
packing.

```{important}
Ensure that the geometry does not exceed 7 tiles in the UV layout; otherwise,
artifacts may appear on consoles.
```

### Overlay Map

The texture is named "overlay" because the shader applies it to the object using
a method similar to the "overlay" blend mode in Photoshop – `multiply2X`.

The purpose of the overlay is to give the object a "lived-in" appearance:
stains, cracks, dirt, soot, etc.

<table style="text-align:center; width:98%"><tr>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:50%"><p>Here is our house without the overlay (technically with a 50% gray overlay – completely disabling it would prevent the shader from functioning). We can see only the brick and stucco – the object looks plasticky:</p></th>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:48%"><p>And here's the house with the overlay applied:</p></th></tr>
</table>

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_10.jpg" width="50%" class="bg-primary">
<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_11.jpg" width="48%" class="bg-primary">

### Universal Overlay

For this demonstration, we used a universal overlay –
`buildings_overlay_tex_d.tif`, which we apply to our houses and simpler
structures like fences. It looks like this:

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_12.jpg" width="50%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

Conceptually, it's divided into 16 cells (with indices starting from 0, not 1):

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_13.jpg" width="50%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

- **Cells 0-1** are used to decorate the building's interior materials (walls
  with wallpaper/stucco).

  ```{note}
  As shown, these two cells contain four smaller cells each – ensure that the
  seams between these cells do not fall on a flat surface, or else a distinct
  vertical line will appear on the model! For example:
  ```

  <img src="_images/rendinst_layered_14.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

  <br>

- **Cell 2** is used to decorate wooden roof trim, similar to this:

  <img src="_images/rendinst_layered_15.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

  <br>

  It should be mapped as follows:
    - Either using a horizontal plane of 55x55 meters. Vertical supports should
      be mapped separately in the vertical plane;
    - Or using box and flatten mapping.

- **Cells 3, 6, 7** are currently unused.
- **Cells 4-5** are used to decorate roofs:
  - **Cell 4** is for sloped roofs;
  - **Cell 5** is for flat roofs.
- **Cells 8-15** are used to decorate the building's exterior.

In the example above, **cell 11** was used. Here's how it works:

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_16.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

```{important}
All external surfaces of the building, except for the roof, should only be
mapped to **cell 8**. The shader will automatically shift the mapping to cells
**9-15**. More on this in the shader settings.
```

```{note}
In the early stages of *War Thunder*'s development, universal overlays were
widely used. However, as the project evolved, we transitioned to unique
overlays. Consequently, the content of this section is now outdated. Despite
this, universal overlays can still be employed, though they are better suited
for smaller objects rather than larger structures like buildings.
```

### Unique Overlay

The universal overlay was designed to automate visual variety in objects – by
creating one house, you can give it up to eight different appearances without
any additional work. However, this map is not suitable for unique objects, as it
cannot emphasize the distinctive features that make an object more "alive".

Let's look at an example of a unique overlay:

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_17.jpg" width="50%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

As you can see, the entire texture is dedicated to a unique UV layout,
reflecting soot marks on walls at bullet impact sites, rotting wood (small
details), moss-covered foundations, etc.

It was created for a partially ruined church:

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_18.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

### Exclusion Mask

This texture resides in the alpha channel of the overlay map and therefore uses
the same UV2. Let's examine it using the universal overlay's alpha channel as an
example.

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_19.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

This is a black-and-white mask. It defines the global areas on the model where
we want to preserve only the first detail or only the second.

- **Black pixels** – only the first detail will remain.
- **White pixels** – only the second detail will remain.
- **Intermediate grayscale values** – adjust the global heightmaps of the two
  details.

Why is this necessary? Let's see how the details mix with a 50% gray exclusion
mask. (For clarity, we'll set the overlay to the same 50% gray so it doesn't
interfere with the detail mixing.)

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_20.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

Several issues are apparent:

1. The tiling pattern is fully readable. Even after applying the overlay, this
   might not be corrected, as the overlay cells (when using the universal
   overlay) have varying levels of "dirtiness." For example, using **cell 8**
   produces the following result:

   <img src="_images/rendinst_layered_21.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

   <br>

It's clear that the tiling is still visible.

2. Detail2 (stucco) blends with Detail1 (bricks) uniformly and boringly across
   the entire wall area. This can be somewhat improved by using a dirtier
   overlay. For example, let's try **cell 11**:

   <img src="_images/rendinst_layered_22.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

   <br>

Yes, it looks better. However, problem 1 remains – the cells are used
automatically, and the mapping will inevitably shift to a less detailed cell.

The exclusion mask is designed to address these specific issues. It globally
overrides the heightmaps of the details across the entire object mapped to it,
causing the blending to be rough and uneven. This helps hide the tiling (it's
hard to notice when Detail2 covers different parts of Detail1) and eliminates
uniform blending.

Let's switch the exclusion mask from gray to the original.

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_23.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

The result is clear – both issues are resolved. However, **cell 8** is rather
sparse for both the overlay and the exclusion mask.

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_24.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

Let's see what happens if we shift the UV2 mapping to **cell 11**. In the
screenshots above, it worked with a gray exclusion mask. Now let's see its full
effect.

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_25.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_26.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

There is no visible tiling. The details blend randomly. The overlay adds even
more detail.

The more varied the exclusion mask, the smoother the detail
blending. The more gradients and fewer sharp transitions it contains, the
smoother the boundaries between details.

```{important}
In summary, the exclusion mask controls where Detail1 (the object's base
material) is visible – where its pixels are black–and where Detail2 (the
object's covering) appears – where its pixels are white.

Where the pixels are gray, the details blend based on their heightmaps, taking
into account the "grayness" of the exclusion mask:

- If the mask is 50% gray, only the heightmaps are used.
- If it is darker than 50%, the heightmap of Detail1 is stronger.
- If it is lighter than 50%, the heightmap of Detail2 takes precedence.
```

### Blending Mask

#### How It Works

The blending mask is the final texture we utilize. Let's examine it using the
example of the `brick_stucco_m.tif` texture, which was applied to the house we
discussed earlier.

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_27.jpg" width="50%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

**What does it do?** Essentially, it performs the same function as the exclusion
mask:

- Black areas reveal Detail1.
- White areas reveal Detail2.
- Gray areas blend the two details based on their heightmaps and the gray value
  of the blending mask.

Let's recall how the house looked without a blending mask (in the earlier
screenshots, it was filled with 50% gray).

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_28.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

Now, let's see how the house appears with the `brick_stucco_m.tif` blending
mask applied.

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_29.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

The difference is subtle – the exclusion mask creates a more noticeable change.
This is because, on UV2, our house occupies a single cell, which is quite
insignificant in the context of the blending mask.

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_30.jpg" width="50%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

So, why do we need a blending mask that seemingly duplicates the exclusion mask,
but with less impact?

There are four key points to understand:

1. In reality, details are not blended solely by the exclusion mask.
2. Similarly, details are not blended solely by the blending mask.
3. The exclusion mask and blending mask are combined to create the final global
   blending mask, which dictates how the details are blended.

   ```{note}
   These masks are combined using standard multiplication (not *Photoshop*'s
   Multiply mode).
   ```
4. Our `rendinst_layered` shader randomly offsets the blending mask (the local
   one we're discussing) based on the position of the house on the map.

To summarize in simpler terms:

1. Place the house on the map, for instance, at the center.
2. The blending mask and exclusion mask combine to form the global blending
   mask.
   - Black areas reveal Detail1.
   - White areas reveal Detail2.
   - Intermediate gray values influence the blending of details based on their
     heightmaps.
3. Move the house slightly, and the blending mask and exclusion mask are
   multiplied again, creating a new global blending mask and altering how the
   details blend.

Here's how it looks in practice:

```{eval-rst}

.. only:: html

   .. video:: _images/rendinst_layered_31.webm
      :width: 80%

.. only:: latex

   `Download video (WEBM) <https://github.com/GaijinEntertainment/DagorEngine/blob/main/_docs/source/assets/shaders/_images/rendinst_layered_31.webm>`_

```

Each movement triggers a reassembly of the global blending mask via multiplying
the exclusion mask and the local blending mask, which results in the same object
having a different appearance as it is repositioned.

This is the core function of the blending mask. We cannot offset the exclusion
mask since it contains a unique mapping of detail blending (even within the
cells). The blending mask is designed precisely for this purpose.

#### Specifics of Using the Blending Mask

We used the `brick_stucco_m.tif` as our example. The name itself indicates that
it represents stucco over brick, meaning it's intended for a specific type of
detail blending – Detail2 (stucco) is layered over Detail1 (brick) with clear
boundaries.

Let's look at a real brick house with stucco, such as this one:

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_32.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

The concept becomes clear – stucco peels off in sheets, revealing the underlying
wall material.

How did we achieve this effect on our house? The current blending mask has sharp
transitions between black and white, with almost no gradients. This means we
either see the brick (black areas) or the stucco (white areas).

But what if we want to create a stone wall with moss growing between the stones?
We'd use a stone texture (`medieval_brick_d.tif`) and a moss texture
(`moss_different_d.tif`). Let's examine these textures and their heightmaps.

1. **Stone Masonry**: Its heightmap clearly indicates that any Detail2 should
   only appear between the stones. Recall that the heightmap function – the
   lighter the area, the stronger the effect.

   <img src="_images/rendinst_layered_33.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

   <br>

2. **Moss**: Its heightmap suggests that it doesn't matter where it grows. It's
   uniformly gray, meaning it will be overpowered by almost any other detail's
   heightmap.

   <img src="_images/rendinst_layered_34.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

   <br>

Let's see how these details blend with the current blending mask. Remember, the
moss heightmap will likely be overridden by the stone heightmap, so the moss
should only appear between the stones – exactly what we want.

However, what we get is moss applied over the entire wall surface.

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_35.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

**Why did this happen?**

Because our blending mask is unsuitable. As stated earlier:

- "What does the blending mask do? It functions exactly like the exclusion mask.
  Black areas reveal Detail1, white areas reveal Detail2, and gray areas blend
  the two details according to their heightmaps and the gray value of the
  blending mask."
- "The current blending mask has sharp transitions between black and white, with
  almost no gradients. This means we either see the brick (black) or the stucco
  (white)."

Our `brick_stucco_m.tif` blending mask has overridden the detail heightmaps and
distributed them as it saw fit.

**What to do in such cases?** Change the blending mask.

The approach is straightforward:

- Ensure that the detail heightmaps are not overridden.
- Detail heightmaps are not overridden by gray.
- We need smooth transitions between the details.

**Conclusion**: We need a blending mask with lots of gray and few sharp
boundaries – everything should be gradient-based.

Let's try `gypsum_m.tif`. It's not a perfect mask, but it's better than the
previous one. We can see that it contains a lot of gray, with minimal
black/white areas and many gradients. There are some patches, but they're small
and sparse.

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_36.jpg" width="50%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

Now, let's see how it performs.

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_37.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

The moss remains in some places, but mostly it has receded to the gaps between
the stones. The remaining local patches can be removed if needed, but that would
require additional methods.

Remember that these masks will be multiplied, and the final appearance will
continue to evolve:

```

### Conclusion

A concise summary of how the shader uses textures:

1. Two details are blended based on their heightmaps (through alpha test).

2. The exclusion and blending masks combine to create the final global blending
   mask for detail blending (using standard multiplication, not *Photoshop*'s
   Multiply mode).

   This raises a question: Why not blend the details directly using this mask?
   Why do we need detail heightmaps as well?

   Because the blending mask has a large texel size, blending directly would
   result in blurry textures. Using the detail heightmaps allows for a sharper
   blend.

3. When the heightmaps are combined with the blended masks, the result is that
   within the large texel of the global blending mask (which covers the entire
   building), several smaller texels of the local blending mask are nested.
   These smaller texels are where the detail heightmaps interact. This process
   ensures that the image remains sharp, as the local blending mask allows for
   finer detail within each texel of the global mask.

4. Next, a normal map and an overlay map are applied on top of the blended
   details. These maps add texture and additional detail to the surface,
   enhancing the visual complexity of the material.

5. Finally, when the object using this shader is repositioned, the blending mask
   is offset. This offsetting causes the global blending mask to change, which
   in turn alters how the details are mixed. As a result, the object's
   appearance shifts as the blending of the details adjusts to the new position.

### Shader Setup

#### General Shader Parameters

When setting up the shader, the initial view displays the basic parameters,
which can be further expanded for customization.

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_39.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

**Two key points to note:**

1. The shader is part of the **Dagor Material 2** set.

   <img src="_images/rendinst_layered_40.jpg" width="50%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

   <br>

2. The **Add** button allows access to additional parameters.

   <img src="_images/rendinst_layered_41.jpg" width="50%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

   <br>

#### Texture Assignment

Textures are assigned to slots in the following order:

- Slot 1 – Overlay
- Slot 2 – Blending Mask
- Slot 3 – Normal Map
- Slot 4 – Detail1 Diffuse
- Slot 5 – Detail1 Normal Map
- Slot 6 – Detail2 Diffuse
- Slot 7 – Detail2 Normal Map

#### Shader Parameters

The shader offers a range of parameters for customization:

- `atlas_first_tile`/`atlas_last_tile`/`atlas_tile_u`/`atlas_tile_v`: Group of
  parameters that manages the offset of uv-mapping on the universal overlay.
- `detail_tile_u/v`: Controls the tiling of details.
- `detail_scroll_u/v`: Adjusts the scrolling of details.
- `mask_gamma_start/end`: Configures the transparency of Detail1 through
  Detail2.
- `mask_tile_u/v`: Controls the tiling of the blending mask.
- `mask_scroll_u/v`: Adjusts the scrolling of the blending mask.
- `draw_grass`: Enables grass growth on the object.
- `detail2_colored`: Allows to colorize Detail2 in the *Dagor Editor* tool (an
  outdated feature rarely used).
- `top_projection`: Group of parameters that allows to project Detail2 above the
  Detail1 using global and local normals.
- `top_projection_from`
- `top_projection_to`
- `top_projection_detail2_modulate`
- `use_painting`: Group of parameters used for colorizing of details.
- `painting_line`
- `paint1stdetail`
- `detail2_combined_normal`: Blends details' normal maps.
- `micro_detail_layer1`: Group of parameters for microdetails.
- `micro_detail_layer2`
- `micro_detail_layer1_uv_scale`
- `micro_detail_layer2_uv_scale`
- `material_shadow_influence`: Controls shadow strength from the details.
- `material_shadow_scale`: Adjusts the shadow size from the details.

#### Offset of UV-mapping on the Universal Overlay

To use the universal overlay effectively, remember the rule stated earlier:

```{important}
All exterior surfaces of the building, except the roof, should be mapped to
**cell 8**. The shader will automatically shift the mapping across **cells
9-15**.
```

The shader and universal overlay/mask are designed to automate content
variation. By mapping the exterior of the building to **cell 8**, the shader
will automatically shift the mapping to other cells, creating varied appearances
without manual intervention.

For example, if the walls and exterior parts of the house are mapped to **cell
8**:

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_42.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

The shader will automatically shift the mapping to **cell 9**:

```{eval-rst}

.. only:: html

   .. video:: _images/rendinst_layered_43.webm
      :width: 80%

.. only:: latex

   `Download video (WEBM) <https://github.com/GaijinEntertainment/DagorEngine/blob/main/_docs/source/assets/shaders/_images/rendinst_layered_43.webm>`_

```

However, this automatic shifting requires specific parameters to be set. The
universal overlay cells are as follows:

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_44.jpg" width="50%" align="left" class="bg-primary">

- **cells 0-1**: For internal materials (walls with wallpaper/stucco).
- **cell 2**: For decorative wooden roof elements.
- **cells 3, 6, 7**: Currently unused.
- **cells 4-5**: For roof decoration: **cell 4** for sloped roofs, **cell 5**
  for flat roofs.
- **cells 8-15**: For decorating external parts of buildings.

<br clear="left">

To enable the shader to recognize and use these cells, the following parameters
must be set:

- `atlas_first_tile`: Start cell number for the mapping jump (usually **cell
  8**).
- `atlas_last_tile`: End cell number for the mapping jump (usually **cell 15**).
- `atlas_tile_u`: Horizontal jump size in fractions of the texture width (e.g.,
  0.5).
- `atlas_tile_v`: Vertical jump size in fractions of the texture height (e.g.,
  0.125).

For the universal overlay to work correctly, you need to add these parameters
using the **Add** button and set their values as follows:

- `atlas_first_tile = 8`
- `atlas_last_tile = 15`
- `atlas_tile_u = 0.5`
- `atlas_tile_v = 0.125`

If these parameters are not set, the overlay will not shift correctly:

```{eval-rst}

.. only:: html

   .. video:: _images/rendinst_layered_45.webm
      :width: 80%

.. only:: latex

   `Download video (WEBM) <https://github.com/GaijinEntertainment/DagorEngine/blob/main/_docs/source/assets/shaders/_images/rendinst_layered_45.webm>`_

```

In some cases, you may want to limit the use of certain cells. For example,
wooden walls may not look good with stucco cracks and stains.

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_46.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

In such cases, set `atlas_last_tile = 10` to limit the jump to **cells 8-10**,
which are more neutral:

```{eval-rst}

.. only:: html

   .. video:: _images/rendinst_layered_47.webm
      :width: 80%

.. only:: latex

   `Download video (WEBM) <https://github.com/GaijinEntertainment/DagorEngine/blob/main/_docs/source/assets/shaders/_images/rendinst_layered_47.webm>`_

```

#### Detail Tiling Settings

The tiling of details is controlled by the parameters:

- `detail1/2_tile_u`: Adjusts the horizontal tiling of Detail1/2.
- `detail1/2_tile_v`: Adjusts the vertical tiling of Detail1/2.

By default, if these parameters are not set, they are assumed to be `1`.

These settings are useful when:

- The texels of the detail textures do not match, or
- You want to adjust the display size of one detail relative to another.

Here's an example of a house corner with the brick detail tiling set to `1` and
the stucco detail tiling set to `0.5`:

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_48.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

The stucco appears blurry because its texel size is twice as large as the brick.
Comparing the textures:

<table style="text-align:center; width:98%"><tr>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:49%"><p>Modern Brick Brown Dirt (1024x1024)</p></th>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:49%"><p>Stucco New (512x512)</p></th></tr>
</table>

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_49.jpg" width="49%" class="bg-primary">
<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_50.jpg" width="49%" class="bg-primary">

Increasing the stucco tile by 2x for both axes corrects this:

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_51.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

However, you might want a more refined stucco finish without large, clear holes.
Setting the stucco tile to `2.54` achieves this:

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_52.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

The result is a house with a more refined stucco texture. However, be cautious,
as extreme mismatches in texel sizes can lead to visual inconsistencies,
particularly on less detailed surfaces like roofs.

For instance, moss with a tile of `5.35` on a roof with a tile of 1 shows a
noticeable mismatch:

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_53.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

To avoid such issues, always check texture sizes and the final result, ensuring
there's no visible mismatch.

```{important}
It's better to use non-integer tiling parameters (e.g., `1.54` instead of `1.5`,
`2.35` instead of `2`). This reduces the visibility of the tiling pattern.
```

#### Disabling Tiling (detail1/2_scroll_u=-1)

```{important}
Use just `detail1/2_scroll_u` to disable detail scaling. Don't use `scroll_v`,
because it's incorrect and leads to visual bugs.
```

When scaling an object, tiling is often automatically applied based on the
object's size, which can cause unwanted effects on unique UV mappings. For
instance, scaling a stone object 100 times can make the details tile 100 times
more frequent.

**Example:**

<table style="text-align:center; width:98%"><tr>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:48%"><p>100% scale</p></th>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:50%"><p>1000% scale</p></th></tr>
</table>

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_54.jpg" width="48%" class="bg-primary">
<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_55.jpg" width="50%" class="bg-primary">

The technology is useful, because it saves us texel when scaling objects.
However, a problem arises when we use such a shader on objects with unique UV.
For example, we take a bunch of tires and make them “dusty”. Detail1 mapping is
scaled when we scale the model of tires. But uv-mapping for this model is unique
- we get visual bug.

**Example:**

<table style="text-align:center; width:98%"><tr>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:44%"><p>100% scale:</p></th>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:54%"><p>200% scale:</p></th></tr>
</table>

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_56.jpg" width="44%" class="bg-primary">
<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_57.jpg" width="54%" class="bg-primary">

To prevent this, set `detail1_scroll_u=-1` to disable tiling for a specific
detail when scaling is not desired.

<table style="text-align:center; width:98%"><tr>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:98%"><p>200% scale with detail1_scroll_u=-1</p></th></tr>
</table>

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_58.jpg" width="54%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

### Configuring Detail Offset

Control the horizontal and vertical offsets of details using:
- `detail1/2_scroll_u` – Horizontal offset.
- `detail1/2_scroll_v` – Vertical offset.

Default values are `1`. Use these settings when precise alignment of details is
necessary, such as aligning bricks in a wall section.

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_62.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_63.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_64.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

To do this, we set the brick parameters `detail1_scroll_u` and
`detail1_scroll_v` to 0. What happens if we don't set these parameters? For
example, `detail1_scroll_u`:

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_65.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

We ended up with horizontal shifts in the texture, resulting in uneven seams: in
some places, the bricks vary in thickness, while in others, they appear
unusually short.

It's easy to imagine what happens if `detail1_scroll_v=0` is not set – complete
misalignment of the fence edges."

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_66.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

```{important}
Don't set these parameters without a good reason. They limit the number of
variations you can achieve with your objects, so only use them when absolutely
necessary.
```

### Configuring of Details Blending

Details are blended with the final blending mask, that represents a result of
combining of several masks (details' heightmaps, exclusion mask, blending mask).

We can modify this final blending mask by raising it to the needed power - we
call it Gamma.

There're 2 parameters:

- `mask_gamma_start` – smallest needed gamma value.
- `mask_gamma_end` – largest needed gamma value.

We specify them both and `Dagor` chooses final gamma value between them
randomly. Our final blending mask is raised to the power of this gamma value.

Imagine final blending mask as a set of values – not colors. Black is `0`. White
is `1`. Nearly white is, for instance, `0.95`.

Raise `0.95` to the power of `2` and you'll get `0.9`. But raise `0.95` to the
power of `0.2` and you'll get `0.9898`.

It means that the smaller gamma values you specify – the brighter final blending
mask you get. And more of Detail2 will be seen.

On the contrary the larger gamma values you specify – the darker final blending
mask you get. And more of detail1 will be seen.

For instance, we want to reduce the visibility of the stucco on this house.

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_67.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

We assign the blend mask `gypsum_m` as it is the most "gentle" and gray, and we
get the following result:

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_68.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

This is not sufficient. Let's set the following parameter values:

- `mask_gamma_start = 4`
- `mask_gamma_end = 8`

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_69.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

### Configuring Blend Mask Tiling

This is controlled by the following parameters:

- `mask_tile_u` – horizontal tiling of the blend mask;
- `mask_tile_v` – vertical tiling of the blend mask.

If these parameters are not set, they default to `1`.

These parameters are usually needed to add variety to the appearance of an
object. For example, here is our fence with the `gypsum_m` mask tiling set to
`1`.

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_70.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

We want to reduce the size of the moss patches but increase their frequency.
Let's set the mask tiling to `8.75`.

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_71.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

Unlike detail textures, the blend mask can be tiled non-proportionally. For
instance, we can keep the vertical tiling at `1` while setting the horizontal
tiling to `8.75`.

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_72.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

There will be no stretching of textures – we've simply created narrower and
taller blend areas, as the mask tiles nearly 9 times more frequently
horizontally than vertically. This technique can be useful when you need to
create "leaks" using the Detail2 layer.

### Configuring Blend Mask Offset

This is controlled by the following parameters:

- `mask_scroll_u` – horizontal offset of the mask;
- `mask_scroll_v` – vertical offset of the mask.

By default (when not added to the material), these values are set to `1`.

In the shader textures documentation, we mentioned that the blend mask offsets
each time the object's position in space changes. Let's revisit how this looks
with the overlay removed:

```{eval-rst}

.. only:: html

   .. video:: _images/rendinst_layered_73.webm
      :width: 80%

.. only:: latex

   `Download video (WEBM) <https://github.com/GaijinEntertainment/DagorEngine/blob/main/_docs/source/assets/shaders/_images/rendinst_layered_73.webm>`_

```

These parameters increase the offset value, allowing for more varied blending of
detail layers. Let's set these values to `0.5`.

```{eval-rst}

.. only:: html

   .. video:: _images/rendinst_layered_74.webm
      :width: 80%

.. only:: latex

   `Download video (WEBM) <https://github.com/GaijinEntertainment/DagorEngine/blob/main/_docs/source/assets/shaders/_images/rendinst_layered_74.webm>`_

```

As you can see, the changes between blends became

- sometimes more visible,
- sometimes less visible.

This is because the offsets of our blend mask became smaller. And uv-mapping
stays more time on areas that it used to jump over with offset=1.

We rarely use this parameter, because it's much easier to random blending change
with more varied blending mask.

```{important}
If you need to disable blend mask jumps, use the parameter `mask_tile_u=-1`.
Not the scroll, but the tiling, specifically `mask_tile_u` set to `-1`.
```

### Growing Grass on an Object

If you need to "grow" grass on a rendinst geometry, set the `draw_grass`
parameter in its material to a value of `1`. It's important to apply this on a
nearly horizontal surface to prevent grass from growing on walls.

### Coloring the Detail2 in the daEditor (Deprecated)

In the initial version of the coloring process, the color range was specified
directly in the [*daEditor*](../../dagor-tools/daeditor/daeditor/daeditor.md).
Only the Detail2 (the "upper" one) was colored, using a simple multiply
operation. This required careful selection of colors to avoid over-saturation.

The process was as follows:

1. The parameter `detail2_colored` was set to `1`.
2. In the *daEditor*, a color gradient was applied set in the **Properties >
   Textures > Rendinst 2-nd detail color** section.

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_112.jpg" width="49%" class="bg-primary">
<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_113.jpg" width="49%" class="bg-primary">

### Top Projection - Projecting the Detail2 using Local and Global Normals

There are scenarios where you need to add snow, sand, or moss to an object. For
this, the `top_projection` feature is used. It projects the Detail2 layer on top
of the Detail1 at a specified angle. For instance, on a stone surface, you can
project snow on top of the stone detail.

The parameters for this feature are:

- `top_projection` – 0/1 (off/on);
- `top_projection_from` – the angle at which the projected detail starts to
  appear (at a minimal amount);
- `top_projection_to` – the angle at which the projected detail fully covers the
  object;
- `top_projection_detail2_modulate` – the intensity of the projection's effect
  on the Detail2 layer.

The function takes into account all normals:

1. Global geometry normals.
2. Global normal map normals.
3. Local detail layer normals.

The function also takes into consideration the masks:

1. Exclusion mask (overlay alpha) – if set to black, the Detail2 layer
   will not appear.
2. Blend mask.
3. However, it does NOT take into account the heightmap of the Detail1 layer,
   as it could be very bright (e.g., stucco). If it were considered, projection
   would be difficult.

This is a procedural function – rotate the object as you like, and the Detail2
layer will cover it according to the specified rules, from the appropriate side.

```{eval-rst}

.. only:: html

   .. video:: _images/rendinst_layered_75.webm
      :width: 80%

.. only:: latex

   `Download video (WEBM) <https://github.com/GaijinEntertainment/DagorEngine/blob/main/_docs/source/assets/shaders/_images/rendinst_layered_75.webm>`_

```

Let's examine how these parameters work.

#### top_projection

This parameter has values `0` and `1` (off/on).

#### top_projection_from

Specifies the angle at which the projected detail begins to appear (at a minimal
amount). The angle is specified not in degrees but in the sine of the angle. For
example, if you want the snow to start at 45 degrees, take sin(45) = 0.7 and
enter `0.7` as the value.

<table style="text-align:center; width:98%"><tr>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:46%"><p>Parameter value = 0.7</p></th>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:52%"><p>Parameter value = 0.1</p></th></tr>
</table>

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_76.jpg" width="46%" class="bg-primary">
<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_77.jpg" width="52%" class="bg-primary">

#### top_projection_to

Specifies the angle at which the projected detail fully covers the object.
Again, this is specified in the sine of the angle. The difference is less
noticeable than with the starting parameter – it's more apparent on flatter
objects than on steep ones.

<table style="text-align:center; width:98%"><tr>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:49%"><p>Parameter value = 0.5</p></th>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:49%"><p>Parameter value = 1</p></th></tr>
</table>

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_78.jpg" width="49%" class="bg-primary">
<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_79.jpg" width="49%" class="bg-primary">

#### top_projection_detail2_modulate

Specifies the intensity of the overlay's effect on the second detail layer. If
you want pure white snow, set the value to `0`. If you want it to appear dirtier,
increase the parameter up to `1`.

<table style="text-align:center; width:98%"><tr>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:49%"><p>Parameter value = 0.2</p></th>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:49%"><p>Parameter value = 1</p></th></tr>
</table>

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_80.jpg" width="49%" class="bg-primary">
<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_81.jpg" width="49%" class="bg-primary">

In this example, the difference is not very noticeable because the overlay
itself is grayish.

### Blending with Landscape Heightmap

To improve the visual integration of objects with the landscape, you can use
special parameters that allow detail layers of terrain and assets to blend based
on the intersection mask of the asset with the heightmap. This is particularly
useful for piles, rocks, cliffs, and similar objects.

```{important}
This is a computationally expensive technique, so use it sparingly.
```

**Examples:**

<table style="text-align:center; width:98%"><tr>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:49%"><p>Without blend</p></th>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:49%"><p>With blend</p></th></tr>
</table>

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_82.jpg" width="49%" class="bg-primary">
<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_83.jpg" width="49%" class="bg-primary">

Blending parameters:

- `enable_hmap_blend=1` (default: `0`) – Enables/disables heightmap blending.
- `hmap_blend_height=0.1` (default: `0.1`) – Height of the blending.
- `ri_hmap_min_blend_angle=40` – Angle where landscape blending starts to fade
  out. (90 degrees is upward).
- `ri_hmap_max_blend_angle=50` – Angle where landscape blending completely fades
  out. (90 degrees is upward).
- `ri_hmap_blend_angle_vertex_normal_amount=0.75` – Floating value between texel
  (0) or vertex (1) normals as dominant for the blend mask. The higher the
  vertex normal dominance, the lower the chance of the projection appearing on
  triangles with a vertical normal, even if the texel normal is directed upward.
- `ri_hmap_blend_check_holes=1` – Cuts the blend band at the intersection with
  heightmap holes created using `ground_hole:gameobj`. This parameter should be
  added **only** for rocks (or other objects that intersect between the
  heightmap and underground space), as unnecessary checks can significantly
  impact performance.

GPU objects and grass now correctly generate on objects with Heightmap Blending.

#### Global Shader Variables

These are shader parameters initialized in `gamedata/.../scene.blk2` within the
`shader_vars__vars:object` block:

- `ri_hmap_blend_sharpness=8.0` (default: `8.0`) – The higher the value, the
  sharper the blend boundary.
- `ri_hmap_perlin_tex_scale=0.25` (default: `0.25`) – Perlin noise tiling
  multiplier.
- `ri_hmap_min_height=0.5` (default: `0.5`) – Minimum blend height, overriding
  the shader parameter if necessary.

**Examples:**

<table style="text-align:center; width:96%"><tr>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:32%"><p>ri_hmap_blend_sharpness=2</p></th>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:32%"><p>ri_hmap_blend_sharpness=4</p></th>

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_111.jpg" width="32%" class="bg-primary">

#### Static Shader Variables

These are additional shader parameters that adjust the influence of global
shader variables for a specific asset:

- `ri_hmap_blend_sharpness_mul=1.0` – Multiplier for `ri_hmap_blend_sharpness`.
- `ri_hmap_perlin_tex_scale_mul=1.0` – Multiplier for
  `ri_hmap_perlin_tex_scale`.
- `ri_hmap_min_height_mul=1.0` – Multiplier for `ri_hmap_min_height`.

```{note}
  **Global and Static Shader Variables for ri_hmap**

  1. Global shader variables affect all assets on the level with initialized
     blending.
  2. If global shader variables are not initialized in `scene.blk`, the default
    values listed above are applied.
  3. Static shader variables are multipliers of the global shader variables,
     initialized in `scene.blk`, for a specific asset.

  For example, if the global shader variable is set to:

  `ri_hmap_blend_sharpness=8.0`

  and the static shader variable for the asset `example.dag` is:

  `ri_hmap_blend_sharpness_mul=0.5`

  then the final `blend_sharpness` value for the asset `example.dag` on the level
  will be calculated as:

  `blend_sharpness = ri_hmap_blend_sharpness * ri_hmap_blend_sharpness_mul = 8.0 * 0.5 = 4`

    ```{important}
    The heightmap blending shader also works in
    [*daEditor*](../../dagor-tools/daeditor/daeditor/daeditor.md), but since global
    shader variables for the editor are initialized separately and not pulled from
   `scene.blk`, keep in mind that if you choose global shader variable values in
    `scene.blk` that differ from the defaults, the editor will display something
    different from what you'll see in the game.

    Instructions on how to configure global shader variables for the editor will be
    added to the article later.
    ```

```
### Procedural Detail Layer Coloring

You can procedurally color any detail layer (only one at a time) using a
palette.

The palette is called `paint_colors.dds` and is located at
`...\develop\assets\textures\colorize_textures`.

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_86.jpg" width="30%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

It consists of a set of single-pixel rows, each containing between 1 and 64
colors. In the coloring parameters, you specify a particular row for a specific
object (from 0 to the last row in the texture). As the object moves across the
map, each step will randomly shift the pixel within the selected coloring row.
If multiple colors are specified, the object will be procedurally recolored.

```{eval-rst}

.. only:: html

   .. video:: _images/rendinst_layered_87.webm
      :width: 80%

.. only:: latex

   `Download video (WEBM) <https://github.com/GaijinEntertainment/DagorEngine/blob/main/_docs/source/assets/shaders/_images/rendinst_layered_87.webm>`_

```

The coloring is applied based on the diffuse alpha (either the heightmap of the
detail layer or simply a coloring mask for a unique texture).

**Shader parameters:**

- `use_painting` – Controls whether to color detail layers from the palette
  defined in the scene's shader variables.
    - `1` – color,
    - `0` – don't color;
    - values between `0.(01)` and `0.(9)` – partial coloring (multiplier).

  Coloring is based on the diffuse alpha, multiplied by the `use_painting`
  value. Values between `1.(0)1` and `1.(9)` also affect the coloring strength
  from 0.0 to 1.0 but disable random pixel selection from the coloring row when
  the object changes height – useful for consistently coloring modular
  skyscrapers, for example.
- `painting_line` – The coloring row (from 0 to the last row in the texture).
- `paint1stdetail` – Default value is `1` (colors the first detail layer). If
  you need to color the Detail2 layer, set the value to `-1`.

### Normal Blending

There are situations where you need to reveal the underlying texture of the
Detail1 layer (such as metal texture) through the Detail2 layer (such as paint).
This is achieved using the `detail2_combined_normal` parameter, which has two
possible values: `0` (disabled) or `1` (enabled).

<table style="text-align:center; width:98%"><tr>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:49%"><p>Parameter value = 1</p></th>
  <th style="text-align:center; width:49%"><p>Parameter value = 0</p></th></tr>

### Microdetails

```{seealso}
For information on microdetails, see
[Microdetails on Assets](../about-assets/microdetails/microdetails.md).
```

### Material Shadows

Material shadows are generated based on the heightmap of detail layers. The
following parameters are available:

- `material_shadow_influence=0.5, 1, 0, 0` – Controls the "intensity" of
  shadows. Each component affects the corresponding detail layer. For instance,
  `0.5` affects the Detail1 layer, and `1` affects the Detail2 layer. The third
  and fourth components are not used in the `rendinst_layered` shader since it
  only supports two detail layers. However, in the `rendinst_perlin_layered`
  shader, the first three components are used, as it supports three detail
  layers.

- `material_shadow_scale=2` – Acts as a multiplier for the "size" of the
  shadows. This applies to the shadows of all detail layers, as calculating it
  separately for each layer would be computationally expensive.

**Example:**

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_90.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

## Shader Configuration Errors

This occurs when you forget to set all the necessary values. For example, you
might add the parameter `detail2_tile_u=2.54` but forget to include
`detail2_tile_v=2.54`.

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_91.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

At first glance, this might seem insignificant (and this is often where the
inspection ends, unfortunately). However, upon closer examination:

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_92.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

Such subtle issues are common and often go unnoticed until you closely inspect
the settings. Sometimes, for instance, values like `detail2_tile_u=2.3` and
`detail2_tile_v=2.4` are set, which only becomes noticeable upon careful
examination.

### Sloped Roof

Let's recall what a sloped roof tile looks like and how it reflects details:

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_93.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

Remember that each overlay tile contains a specifically designed blending mask.

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_94.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

Here's how this mask works with a house roof:

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_95.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

What happens if we leave the tiling parameters on the roof material?

First, the roof will never land on the correct roof cell because
`atlas_first_tile = 8`. Second, you'll end up with completely arbitrary overlays
and blending.

For example:

<img src="_images/rendinst_layered_96.jpg" width="80%" align="center" class="bg-primary">

<br>

As you can see, the logic of material blending on the roof is completely lost.
The materials blend across the entire surface as if they were on walls, not a
roof. Now, let's see how the overlay appears on the roof.

The result is completely abstract decorations, which have nothing to do with the
intended metal sheets of the roof. This is precisely why the roof cell was
designed to be universal and neutral.

### Flat Roof

Let's recall how the flat roof cell looks and what it represents:

<br>

Here's its exclusion mask:

<br>

In this case, there's no need to show examples of incorrect atlas usage because
there simply aren't any other cells that can fulfill the same function.

### Wooden Roof Trim

Recall that the wooden trim has its own designated - **cell 2**:

<br>

When mapped correctly, the wooden planks look like this (Detail2 shows charred
wood):

<br>

What happens when you apply overlay tiling parameters here?

The mapping jumps to **cell 8**, and instead of smooth blending and a bronzed
appearance, you get these bright planks smeared with tar:
