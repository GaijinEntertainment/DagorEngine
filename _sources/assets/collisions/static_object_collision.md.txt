# Static Object Collision

## Collision Concepts

### About Collisions

Collision geometry, often called a "collider", defines how an object interacts
with the player and the environment. It represents the shapes that physically
block character movement, obstruct bullets, and determine where bullet impact
decals appear.

In practice, collision geometry is contained within the object's `.dag` file and
outlines specific parts of the object. Further details on this structure will be
provided later.

```{note}
To avoid the need to search through the document, here is a summary of common
and project-specific collision parameters:

**Common parameters (used in all projects):**
- `renderable:b=yes`: Enables rendering of the node's visual geometry.
- `collidable:b=yes`: Enables the node to participate in collision calculations.
- `collision:t="mesh"`: Defines the collision type. Supported values are `mesh`,
  `box`, `convex`, and `capsule`.
- `phmat:t="stone"`: Specifies the physical material used for collision.

**Parameters specific to daNetGame-based projects:**
- `isPhysCollidable:b=yes`: Enables the collision for physical interactions such
  as walking, vehicle movement, and object placement.
- `isTraceable:b=yes`: Enables the collision for traces, including shooting,
  object interaction, and bullet decals.
```

### Collision Placement

In War Thunder, collision geometry is typically placed in the final LOD (Level
of Detail) of the object, excluding LOD03. Most commonly, it resides in LOD01 or
LOD02. If the object has only one LOD (LOD00), the collision is placed there.

In daNetGame-based projects, collisions are generally placed in LOD01.

During the [resource
building](../../dagor-tools/resource-building/resource_building.md) process,
collision geometry is automatically collected into a collision pack based on the
rules defined in the `.folder.blk` file.

If the collision shown in the [Asset
Viewer](../../dagor-tools/asset-viewer/asset-viewer/asset_viewer.md) does not
match what was authored, consider the following possible causes:

1. The collision geometry was placed in the wrong LOD.
2. The collision was not exported with the LOD.
3. Collision properties were missing or incorrectly configured.
4. The `.folder.blk` file is referencing the incorrect LOD for collision.

### Collision Parameters

To ensure the engine correctly processes collision geometry, it must be placed
in the appropriate LOD and have the required parameters assigned. These
parameters are applied to the collision object in 3ds Max, where such objects
are referred to as *nodes* in FAR.

There are two ways to assign these parameters:

- **Within FAR**: Parameters can be defined directly using a script block. For
  clarity, they are illustrated below using code examples with comments.
- **In 3ds Max**: Parameters can also be assigned via the object's properties.

  ```{eval-rst}
  .. image:: _images/static_object_collision_01.jpg
     :alt: Object properties in 3ds Max
     :width: 55em
     :align: center
  ```

Let's review the full list of parameters using daNetGame-based project as an
example:

```text
script{
// Common parameters
  renderable:b=yes    // Display the visual geometry of the node
  collidable:b=yes    // Use the node for collision calculations
  collision:t="mesh"  // Collision type: "mesh" (can also be box, convex, capsule)
  phmat:t="stone"     // Collision material

// daNetGame-based project parameters
  isPhysCollidable:b=yes // Use collision for physical interactions (walking, vehicle movement, object placement, etc.)
  isTraceable:b=yes      // Use collision for traces (shooting, object interaction, bullet decals, etc.)
}
```

```{important}
If LOD geometry is being used for collision processing, ensure that the required
parameters are correctly assigned to that geometry. It is not necessary to
duplicate the geometry or create a separate object specifically for collision
purposes.
```

#### General Parameters

These parameters are used across all projects:

- [`renderable:b=yes/no`](#parameter-renderablebyesno)
- [`collidable:b=yes/no`](#parameter-collidablebyesno)
- [`collision:t=""`](#parameter-collisiont)
- [`phmat:t=""`](#parameter-phmatt)

##### Parameter: `renderable:b=yes/no`

This parameter controls whether the collision geometry is rendered.

- `yes`: The geometry is rendered (default).
- `no`: The geometry is not rendered.

```{note}
This parameter is currently non-functional, but it must be specified since it
could be activated in the future.

To ensure the collision geometry is not rendered:
1. Assign it the material `gi_black` (this material is not rendered by the
   engine).
2. Set `renderable:b=no` in the properties.
3. Uncheck the **renderable** box in the same properties.
```

##### Parameter: `collidable:b=yes/no`

This parameter determines whether the collision is functional.

- `yes`: The collision is active (default).
- `no`: The collision is inactive.

Both visual geometry and collision geometry require this parameter. Visual
geometry typically should not have collisions, while collision geometry must
have it enabled.

```{note}
We assign this parameter to both collision geometry and visible non-collidable
geometry.

- For collision geometry: `collidable:b=yes`
- For visible non-collidable geometry: `collidable:b=no`
```

##### Parameter: `collision:t=""`

This parameter defines how the collision geometry is interpreted. Currently,
there are four supported collision types.

###### Type: `mesh`

The default and most resource-intensive collision type. It represents the
geometry with full accuracy, exactly as it is.

**Example**: The `mesh` type is the default collision type, so specifying this
parameter is optional. This behavior originates from War Thunder, where the
`.folder.blk` file could sometimes force collisions to be treated as boxes. To
ensure that certain objects retained `mesh` collisions, the parameter had to be
explicitly set. In daNetGame-based projects, `mesh` collisions are used by
default without needing to specify the parameter.

            :width: 4cm
            :align: center
```

###### Type: `box`

A simple rectangular box is the most lightweight and efficient collision type.
When this type is assigned to a collision object, it creates a box based on the
object's bounding box and uses it as the collision shape.

This collision is treated as a basic box, not as a detailed mesh. In practical
terms, it behaves more like a primitive object in 3ds Max rather than a fully
editable poly mesh.

```{warning}
If you created a box-shaped collision but did not set the `collision:t="box"`
parameter, you've actually created a `mesh` collision in the shape of a box.

The `collision:t="box"` attribute is required for the collision to be treated as
a true box.

A simple way to check:

- A proper `box` collision in [Asset
  Viewer](../../dagor-tools/asset-viewer/asset-viewer/asset_viewer.md) appears
  as a box with white polygon edges (not triangle edges, those aren't shown).
- A `mesh` "box" in [Asset
  Viewer](../../dagor-tools/asset-viewer/asset-viewer/asset_viewer.md) appears
  as regular geometry with red/green triangle edges.
```

**Example 1**: The `box` collision type is ideal for rectangular or small
objects (up to mid-shin height), where the overall shape can be accurately
represented by a simple box. It is the most performance-efficient option.

```

**Example 2**: Small easily breakable objects that do not require detailed
collision such as a tin can can use the `box` type for better performance.

```{eval-rst}

      :class-container: center-grid

Here is how it looks in-game with a `box` collision:

**Example 3**: Small decorative items can also use `box` collisions. These
objects are not part of gameplay and will not be specifically targeted
(excluding rare edge cases).

            :width: 4cm
            :align: center
```

###### Type: `convex`

Convex geometry. Processed more efficiently than a `mesh` but less efficiently
than a `box`.

- Unlike a `box`, this type does not generate a bounding box around the
  geometry; it uses the actual convex shape.
- If the geometry is not `convex`, errors will appear in [Asset
  Viewer](../../dagor-tools/asset-viewer/asset-viewer/asset_viewer.md) (this
  will be explained later).

As with `box`, `convex` collisions are only recognized as such when this
parameter is specified. If it is missing, a `convex` collision will be displayed
semi-transparent instead of with highlighted edges.

**Example**: The `convex` collisions provide detailed yet relatively efficient
processing.

```{eval-rst}
.. only:: html

   .. grid:: 1
      :class-container: center-grid

      .. grid-item::
         :class: center-cell
         :child-direction: row
         :child-align: center

         .. image:: _images/static_object_collision_11.jpg
            :alt: Convex type collision
            :height: 20em
            :class: image-gap

         .. image:: _images/static_object_collision_12.jpg
            :alt: Convex type collision
            :height: 20em

.. only:: latex

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 50 50
      :align: center

      * - .. image:: _images/static_object_collision_11.jpg
            :width: 4cm
            :align: center

        - .. image:: _images/static_object_collision_12.jpg
            :width: 4cm
            :align: center
```

Use `convex` (or `box`) collisions whenever appropriate, especially for
frequently repeated objects, to optimize collision handling. However, do not
sacrifice collision quality just to use `convex`.

###### `capsule`

Capsule-shaped collision. More efficient than `mesh` but less efficient than
`box`.

Like the `box` type, this parameter creates a capsule around the bounding box of
the collision geometry and treats it as such only when the property is
specified.

**Example**: The `capsule` collision type is used for cylindrical objects.

Since few static objects have simple cylindrical shapes that can be represented
by one or two capsules, this type is rarely applied to static objects. It is
more commonly used in destrs, where cylindrical parts can be isolated and
assigned `capsule` collisions.

.. only:: html

   .. grid:: 1
      :class-container: center-grid

      .. grid-item::
         :class: center-cell

         :child-align: center

            :width: 4cm
            :align: center
```

##### Parameter: `phmat:t=""`

This parameter defines the physical material assigned to an object, ensuring
appropriate sound effects for impacts, decals, and footsteps are applied to its
surface.

It is specifically applied to collision geometry. For objects using multiple
materials, the collision geometry must be segmented accordingly, with each
segment assigned the correct physical material.

```{important}
For objects featuring both trace and physical collisions, physical materials
("physmats") must be defined for both collision types.
```

Physical material names are predefined and must adhere to established naming
conventions. To view the physical material assigned to a collision in [Asset
Viewer](../../dagor-tools/asset-viewer/asset-viewer/asset_viewer.md), select the
collision geometry in the viewport. The object's properties panel will display
the assigned physical material.

```{seealso}
For more information, see
[Physmats](../materials/physmats.md).
```

This approach also serves as a validation method: if "default" appears instead
of the expected physmat, it indicates that an invalid or no physical material
has been assigned.

```{eval-rst}

If the required physmat is not available, attempt to locate the closest matching
material. If no suitable alternative exists, submit a request for a new material
to be created. Avoid assigning a non-existent physmat arbitrarily, as this will
cause the system to default to the generic "default" material, resulting in
unintended behavior.

Asset managers can review the current list of physical materials in the
`physmat.blk` file. For War Thunder, this file is located at
`<project_name>/develop/gameBase/config`.

#### daNetGame-based Project Parameters

These parameters are specific to daNetGame-based projects and must **not** be
used in War Thunder.

- `isPhysCollidable:b=yes/no`
- `isTraceable:b=yes/no`

```{important}
It is essential to understand that these parameters operate independently. Each
controls a distinct aspect of collision behavior, with no overlap between them.

For example, physical collision may be defined as `convex`, while trace
collision can use a `box` type. These represent separate systems that function
without interfering with one another.
```

#### Parameters: `isPhysCollidable`/`isTraceable`

These parameters are presented together because, although they operate
independently, they are frequently used in conjunction. Neither parameter
disables the other; instead, each explicitly indicates the intended purpose of a
specific collision.

By default, collisions are treated as applicable for both physical interaction
and tracing. Therefore, defining a collision without specifying these parameters
leaves ambiguity about its role.

```{important}
If an object contains multiple collision meshes and one mesh is explicitly
designated as either a "trace" or "physical" collision, you must assign
corresponding parameters to **all** other meshes. Failure to do so will cause
those meshes to inherit the properties of the explicitly defined mesh,
potentially resulting in unintended trace-only or physical-only collision
behavior.
```

- `isPhysCollidable:b=yes`: This parameter designates collisions that interact
  exclusively with the character's capsule. Since most player-environment
  interactions occur through the capsule and exclude shooting, these collisions
  do not register interactions with weapons. Players can shoot, slash, or strike
  through them without obstruction.

  Collisions marked with this parameter are simplified to approximate the
  general shape of objects or object parts with which the player physically
  interacts, such as surfaces to walk on or obstacles to collide against. This
  simplification is critical because capsule collision processing is
  computationally expensive; the simpler the collision geometry, the lower the
  performance cost.

- `isTraceable:b=yes`: This parameter indicates that the collision interacts
  exclusively with the player's weapons, including shooting and melee attacks.
  It does not interact with the character's capsule, allowing the player to move
  through it freely.

  Collisions assigned this parameter are made more precise than physical
  collisions, but only to the degree necessary for accurate bullet tracing. The
  objective is to create a collision that sufficiently covers the shootable
  geometry without unnecessary detail. For example, it is not required to
  include every door handle or small metal rivet on a wooden door just to
  produce accurate hit decals.

  ```{important}
  Trace collision is not without computational cost. Avoid applying trace
  collision to non-essential geometry that does not affect bullet tracing, even
  if it improves visual accuracy for decals. Apply trace collisions only to
  objects that impact gameplay or are large enough that inaccurate decals would
  be noticeable.

           material because it is easier to shoot through than wood, affecting
           bullet penetration, and because its large surface area would look
           unrealistic if wooden decals appeared on it.
```

```{important}
A specific engine behavior to keep in mind: characters interact with physical
collisions using their capsule, but foot placement relies on trace collisions.

For example, consider a large object with a recessed center, such as a flower
bed that the player can climb onto but cannot shoot through in the recessed
area. In this case, the trace collision must accurately include the recess to
ensure correct foot placement. The physical collision, however, should remain
simplified and exclude the recess to reduce processing cost.

If the trace collision does not reflect the actual surface geometry, the
character's feet may appear to float or walk on air, as foot placement is guided
solely by the trace geometry.
```

#### Collision Separation Principles

The core principle is simple: if an object needs to support both physical and
trace interactions, **create two separate collision meshes**, each optimized for
its specific purpose.

- **Physical collisions** should be as simple as possible. Use convex shapes,
  capsules, or boxes whenever feasible to minimize performance cost.
- **Trace collisions** should be only as detailed as necessary to accurately
  capture bullet paths and significant material surfaces. Avoid unnecessary
  complexity that does not affect gameplay.

#### How to Assign Parameters

Collision parameters must always be specified in **pairs**: `isPhysCollidable`
and `isTraceable`. These should **never be assigned individually**, as doing so
may lead to inconsistent or unintended behavior.

- `isPhysCollidable:b=yes` | `isTraceable:b=yes`: These are the **default
  values**. You may specify them explicitly, but it is not required. Including
  them is not considered an error, though it adds no functional value.

- `isPhysCollidable:b=no` | `isTraceable:b=no`: This combination serves no
  practical purpose. If the collision is not needed at all, simply set the
  primary `collidable:b` parameter to `no`.

- `isPhysCollidable:b=yes` | `isTraceable:b=no`: Enables physical collision
  only. The object will block player movement (e.g., walking or driving) but
  will not register weapon traces,bullets and projectiles will pass through.

  ```{important}
  Append the suffix `_phys` to the collision node in the scene to indicate its
  role.
  ```

- `isPhysCollidable:b=no` | `isTraceable:b=yes`: Enables trace collision only.
  The object will block bullets and projectiles but will not obstruct player
  movement—characters and vehicles can pass through it.

  ```{important}
  Append the suffix `_trace` to the collision node in the scene to indicate its
  role.
  ```

#### Guidelines for Using Each Collision Type

These guidelines focus on identifying when a particular type of collision is
**not required**. By default, both physical and trace collisions are enabled
unless explicitly overridden.

#### Physical Collision

Avoid specifying physical collision in the following cases:

- **Small objects** (typically less than knee height), such as scattered bricks,
  books, or bottles. Assigning physical collision to these would cause the
  player to constantly bump into them, resulting in camera jitter and disrupted
  aiming.
- **Flat surfaces** that do not require a distinct physical material, such as
  carpets or decals.
- **Out-of-reach elements** that the player cannot physically interact with,
  such as objects placed high above the playable area or inaccessible
  architectural details.

**Example 1:**

- **Amphora handles**: These are small decorative elements that do not affect
  gameplay or player movement. Collisions with them would have no noticeable
  impact.
- **Upper sections of a pillar**: If the player cannot reach or interact with
  these areas physically, assigning collision is unnecessary.
- **Small details on a milk can**, such as handles: Like the amphora, these
  elements do not influence player movement or interaction and can be safely
  excluded from physical collision.

```

**Example 2:** Compact objects below knee height that the player should not
physically collide with such as small debris or clutter should generally not
have physical collision assigned. Allowing collisions on these items can cause
the player to awkwardly jump or stumble over them, disrupting smooth gameplay
and camera behavior.

omitting a physical material will not impact the sound of footsteps or player
interaction.

   :alt: Flat objects excluded from physical collision

#### Trace Collision

Avoid specifying trace collision in the following cases:

- **Objects or parts never in the line of fire**, where bullets will not
  realistically hit them.
- **Non-essential objects** that players will not engage with in detail; these
  should have simplified collision by removing unnecessary elements.
- **Parts covered by other collision meshes**, such as roof beams hidden beneath
  the main roof geometry.
- **Objects where shooting serves no gameplay purpose**, for example:

  - Books or bricks on the floor that do not break, where the ground impact
    particle effect is sufficient.
  - Posters on walls that do not break, where the wall impact particle effect is
    appropriate.
  - Carpets on floors that do not break, where the floor impact particle effect
    will suffice.

**Example 1:** Handles on an amphora are too small and insignificant to be
considered in the line of fire.

```{eval-rst}
.. image:: _images/static_object_collision_11.jpg
   :alt: Handles on an amphora are too small

**Example 2:** Beams under a ceiling are unlikely to be shot at, similar to
balcony supports attached to walls.

   :alt: Beams under a ceiling are unlikely to be shot at

**Example 3:** Thin shootable elements should not have excessive collision
detail as it may interfere with gameplay by obstructing shots.

need to allocate extra polygons for their collision.

## Collision Design Principles

Effective collision handling relies on several fundamental principles:

- [Collision geometry should be **closed**](#closed-collision-geometry) to
  ensure reliable physics interactions.
- [Collisions must not extend beyond the **visible
  geometry**](#fitting-collision-to-visible-geometry) to prevent unexpected
  clipping or blocking.
- All parts of the object relevant to player interaction must be included.
- Collision meshes should be **highly optimized** to minimize performance
  impact.

These principles can seem contradictory, as some call for detailed accuracy
while others emphasize efficiency. The key challenge is to find the right
balance between precision and optimization.

```{important}
It is essential to differentiate collisions based on an object's **size** and
**gameplay role**:

1. **Gameplay-relevant objects**, such as those in the line of fire, require
   higher collision accuracy, especially for trace collisions, compared to
   non-gameplay objects like props that do not affect bullets or visibility.
2. **Large objects** warrant more detailed collision meshes for both trace and
physical collisions than smaller objects.
```

### Closed Collision Geometry

Collision geometry that contains holes, open edges, or consists of simple planes
can cause clipping issues where objects unintentionally pass through each other.
Therefore, as a fundamental rule, **collision geometry must always be closed**.

When separating physics and trace collisions, trace collisions which are
generally more detailed may omit unseen faces such as those intersecting other
collision geometry. However, physics collisions must **always** maintain closed
geometry to ensure reliable physical interactions.

### Fitting Collision to Visible Geometry

The principle is straightforward: in a shooter game, when a player shoots at an
enemy, and the projectile hits an invisible barrier instead of the visible
object, it diminishes the gameplay experience. This makes precise collision
handling essential.

```{important}
Additionally, note that occluding geometry, such as building walls, relies on
**trace collision**. Extending this collision geometry even slightly beyond the
building's visible boundaries can cause **occlusion bugs**, including incorrect
object visibility when peeking around corners or aiming down sights.
```

**Example 1 (Good)**: A Level of Detail (LOD) model has been optimized by
removing unnecessary loops. Minor protrusions in the collision geometry that do
not affect gameplay or bullet interaction are acceptable.

```{eval-rst}
.. image:: _images/static_object_collision_26.jpg
   :alt: Example 1 (good)
   :width: 30em
   :align: center
```

**Example 2 (Good)**: A small amphora, while not gameplay-critical, may have
minor collision geometry extending beyond the visible object. This does not
impact the game experience since the item is destructible.

```{eval-rst}
.. image:: _images/static_object_collision_11.jpg
   :alt: Example 2 (good)
   :width: 30em
   :align: center
```

**Example 3 (Good)**: The main geometry is properly collidable. Unnecessary
objects that do not impact gameplay are excluded from collision. For example:
- Ceiling beams do not affect the line of fire.
- Balcony fixtures are highly unlikely to be in the line of fire.

```{eval-rst}
.. image:: _images/static_object_collision_33.jpg
   :alt: Example 3 (good)
   :width: 30em
   :align: center
```

**Example 4 (Moderate)**: Only important geometry is included in the collision
mesh. Unnecessary elements that do not influence gameplay, such as beams or
ceiling mounts, are excluded from the collision setup.

```{eval-rst}
.. image:: _images/static_object_collision_27.jpg
   :alt: Example 3 (moderate)
   :width: 50em
   :align: center
```

**Example 5 (Moderate)**: The change in the width of the table leg should be
represented in low-poly form. While shots fired at this area are unlikely,
indoor crouch firefights remain a possibility.

```{eval-rst}
.. image:: _images/static_object_collision_28.jpg
   :alt: Example 5 (moderate)
   :width: 30em

```

**Example 6 (Poor)**: Large vases with collision geometry covering empty spaces
can cause significant issues by creating unintended non-destructible barriers
during gameplay.

   :alt: Example 6 (poor)
   :width: 30em

```

**Example 7 (Poor)**: A large vase with extensive empty spaces included in the
collision mesh is a definite bug.

```

**Example 8 (Poor)**: A house wall acts as an occluding object. Even minimal
collision protrusions can cause objects to disappear from rendering. This was a
previously fixed bug and illustrates how a narrow collision strip creates a
real, non-penetrable space despite appearing thin.

```{eval-rst}
.. image:: _images/static_object_collision_31.jpg
   :alt: Example 8 (poor)
   :width: 50em
   :align: center
```

### Describing Important Parts

It is essential to distinguish which parts of an object require collision and
which do not.

**Example 1**: Small handles on an object do not need collision. They should
neither stop bullets nor cause the object to break unnaturally.

```{eval-rst}
.. image:: _images/static_object_collision_11.jpg
   :alt: Example 1
   :width: 20em
   :align: center
```

**Example 2**: Balcony attachments do not require detailed collision as they are
unlikely to affect gameplay.

```{eval-rst}
.. image:: _images/static_object_collision_22.jpg
   :alt: Example 2
   :width: 20em
   :align: center
```

**Example 3**: There is no need to add collision for small, non-destructible
elements such as broken lamps or decorative insulators.

```{eval-rst}
.. image:: _images/static_object_collision_32.jpg
   :alt: Example 3
   :width: 20em
   :align: center
```

**Example 4**: Very small elements do not require collision.

```{eval-rst}
.. image:: _images/static_object_collision_33.jpg
   :alt: Example 4
   :width: 20em
   :align: center
```

**Example 5**: Apart from the door itself, there is nothing else that requires
collision. Either the object faces the player, making collision details
irrelevant, or it is open with protruding parts against the wall, meaning they
do not impact gameplay.

```{eval-rst}

            :width: 6cm
            :align: center
```

### Collision Optimization

In addition to the principles outlined above, collisions must be optimized by
using the minimal amount of geometry necessary while still adhering to all
guidelines.

There is no universal rule for this process; the goal is to reduce polygon count
as much as possible without compromising gameplay or bullet interactions.

If you can remove unnecessary polygons without affecting how bullets or players
interact with an object, you should do so.

## Simple Collisions: `box`, `convex`, `capsule`

As mentioned earlier, the engine uses three basic types of collision shapes:

- `box`: A rectangular collision volume processed as a box rather than a
  rectangular mesh. This is the simplest and most efficient collision type.
- `convex`: Convex geometry handled as a convex shape instead of a convex mesh.
- `capsule`: A capsule-shaped collision object.

The behavior of these collision shapes depends on both the object properties
(see the [`collision:t="mesh"` parameter](#type-mesh)) and the geometry itself.

```{important}
It is important to understand that **simple collision shapes** improve
performance only when applied to entire objects. Using multiple boxes or convex
shapes to approximate a complex object like a table does not optimize
performance. In such cases, it is better to use a standard mesh. However, if the
collision can be described with one or two simple shapes, such as a box, convex,
or capsule, you should do so.
```

### Box Collision

Box collision is calculated based on the bounding box of an object, with the
collision type assigned as `box`.

If you rotate a box collision in 3ds Max, it will not rotate in the [Asset
Viewer](../../dagor-tools/asset-viewer/asset-viewer/asset_viewer.md). Instead,
the bounding box will be recalculated to align with the world axes. You can
scale, move, and manipulate the box's faces along the axes, but rotating or
moving polygons outside these constraints is not supported.

### Convex Collision

Convex collision is generally simpler to handle but may sometimes behave
unexpectedly in the [Asset
Viewer](../../dagor-tools/asset-viewer/asset-viewer/asset_viewer.md), even if it
appears correct in 3ds Max. This often indicates the presence of concave
triangles, which can be difficult to detect and usually require reworking the
model's triangulation.

```{eval-rst}
.. image:: _images/static_object_collision_36.jpg
   :alt: Convex collision
   :width: 20em
   :align: center
```

Using tools like the MassFX modifier in 3ds Max can simplify this process.

#### 3ds Max: MassFX modifier

**MassFX Modifier Parameters**:

- **Shape**: Set to `convex` since we are working with convex geometry.
- **Generate From**:
  - **Vertices**: Use this option if you want the collision to fit closely to
    the mesh.
  - **Surface**: Use this option to approximate the mesh with collision.
- **Vertices**: Adjusts the vertex count, which affects the polygon count of the
  collision mesh.

```{eval-rst}
.. image:: _images/static_object_collision_37.jpg
   :alt: Convex collision
   :width: 55em
   :align: center
```

Often, you will need to remove parts of the mesh before generating the convex
collision, especially for complex objects. For example, when creating a
collision for a vase model, removing the handles can simplify the convex hull
around the main body of the vase.

```{eval-rst}
.. image:: _images/static_object_collision_11.jpg
   :alt: Convex collision
   :width: 20em
   :align: center
```

#### Optimizing Convex Collision

A common misconception is that because convex collisions are computationally
cheaper than mesh collisions, their polygon count is irrelevant. This is not
true. You should always strive to minimize the polygon count of convex
collisions.

For example, creating a 28-triangle convex collision for a small
10-centimeter-high tin can is excessive. Instead, simplify the polygon count to
the minimum necessary for accurate collision handling.

### Capsule Collision

Capsule collisions do not present unique challenges but should follow the same
principles of optimization and appropriate use. Avoid overcomplicating the
geometry when a simple capsule shape is sufficient.

## Parent-Child Collisions

The engine supports chain destruction with up to two levels of links. You can
designate an object as the parent, and by default, other objects without this
designation become its children.

When a parent object is destroyed, its child objects are destroyed as well. For
example, when a kitchen table breaks, plates placed on it will shatter
accordingly. This behavior is configured through destruction settings and does
not affect the model itself.

However, an important limitation applies: destruction of child objects only
occurs if the child's collision geometry is fully contained within the bounding
box of the parent object's collision.

For example, if a plate's collision is flat and positioned just above the
table's surface, it will not be destroyed when the table breaks.

```{eval-rst}
.. admonition:: Key Rule
   :class: note

   The collision geometry of any object resting on a destructible object must
   extend inside the bounding box of the destructible object for the destruction
   chain to function correctly.
```

For example, consider the collision geometry of amphoras that rest on
destructible surfaces. Notice how their collision geometry extends downward into
the bounding box of the supporting surface to ensure proper destruction
behavior.

```{eval-rst}
.. image:: _images/static_object_collision_11.jpg
   :alt: Collision geometry extends downward into the bounding box of the supporting surface
   :width: 20em
   :align: center
```

```{important}
The chain destruction system operates strictly in one direction: **parent →
child**.

- Destroying a child object does not affect the parent; the parent remains
  intact.
- Destroying a parent object only affects children whose collision geometry
  intersects the parent's bounding box. Children without such intersection will
  remain undestroyed.

Therefore, always designate assets placed on other objects as children, and the
supporting objects as parents. Currently, multi-link destruction chains beyond
two levels are not supported.
```

         :child-align: center

         **Example 1:** Correct. The child's collision (the extended base)
         intersects with the parent's bounding box. Destroying the parent will
         also destroy the amphora.

      .. grid-item::

         **Example 2:** Also correct. The side collision of the amphora
         intersects with the urn's bounding box. Destroying the urn will break
         the amphora.

      .. grid-item::
         :child-direction: row
         :child-align: center

         **Example 3:** Incorrect. The parent object is floating in the air. If
         the parent is destroyed, the amphora will also shatter, but if the
         amphora is destroyed first, the parent will remain floating.

      .. grid-item::

         **Example 4:** Incorrect. Only one amphora (the middle one) intersects
         the parent's bounding box. Destroying the parent will only destroy the
         middle amphora, while the upper one will remain suspended in mid-air.

## Collision Naming Conventions in 3ds Max

Consistent naming is essential for clarity and proper asset processing. Follow
these conventions when naming collision geometry:

1. **Use the `_cls` suffix** for all collision objects.

2. **Base the name on the original 3ds Max object** the collision is intended
   for. For example, if the visual object is named `table_leg_lod00`, the
   collision object should be named `table_leg_cls`.

3. **For physical collisions**, add the `_phys` suffix, for example:
   `table_leg_cls_phys`.

4. **For trace collisions**, add the `_trace` suffix, for example:
   `table_leg_cls_trace`.

## Typical Collision Problems and Pitfalls

The following technical errors in collision geometry can lead to significant
problems:

1. **Unclosed geometry** in physical collisions.
2. **Degenerate triangles**.
3. **Inverted normals**.
4. **Missing triangulation** in complex physical collision geometry.

### Unclosed Geometry in Physical Collisions

As previously mentioned, physical collision geometry **must** be closed. There
are no exceptions to this rule.

### Degenerate Triangles

Collisions containing degenerate triangles can cause client crashes when
interacting with characters or players.

#### Causes

Degenerate triangles arise from:

- Actual degenerate triangles (collapsed or zero-area triangles).
- Unwelded vertices with duplicate edges.
- Isolated vertices (vertices not connected to any geometry).

#### Detection Methods

Degenerate triangles can be identified through:

- **3ds Max export logs**, which flag classic degenerate triangles during the
  export process.
- **Console output in the Asset Viewer**, which will display errors such as:

   ```text
   stalingrad_city_balcony_1500x2000_a_collision: degenerate tri 10,13,11:
   (0.910, -1.404, 0.731), (0.983, -1.477, 0.731), (0.990, -1.484, 0.731)
   (edge len: 0.103137, 0.00999993, 0.113137)
   ```

#### Fixing Methods

Degenerate triangles can be resolved through various methods:

- **Remove degenerates** using the built-in Dagor Utility.

  ```{eval-rst}
  .. image:: _images/static_object_collision_42.jpg
    :alt: Remove degenerates
    :width: 15em
    :align: center
  ```

- **Weld vertices** with a very small delta (e.g., less than 2 mm) to ensure the
  shape of the geometry is not altered.
- **Remove isolated vertices** through the remove isolated vertices command.

```{eval-rst}
.. important::

   Some issues may require manual intervention. For example, long, thin
   triangles may not be fixed by automated tools. In such cases, inspect the
   coordinates of problematic vertices and manually correct the geometry.

   .. image:: _images/static_object_collision_43.jpg
      :alt: Manually correction
      :width: 20em
      :align: center
```

### Inverted Normals

Inverted normals in collision geometry can cause characters to stick or appear
to be glued to the surface.

#### Causes

Inverted normals typically result from:

- Negative scale matrices (even though normals might appear correct in 3ds Max).

  ```{eval-rst}
  .. image:: _images/static_object_collision_44.jpg
    :alt: Remove degenerates
    :width: 55em
    :align: center
  ```

- Flipped polygons.

  ```{eval-rst}
  .. image:: _images/static_object_collision_45.jpg
    :alt: Remove degenerates
    :width: 55em
    :align: center
  ```

#### Detection Methods

##### Flipped Polygons

Flipped polygons can only be detected visually in 3ds Max; they are not flagged
automatically.

##### Inverted Scale Matrices

Inverted scale matrices can be found in the daBuild logs. Use the following
steps:

1. Run daBuild (you can run it just for collisions for faster results):

   ```text
   ../../tools/dagor3_cdk/bin64/dabuild-dev.exe ../application.blk -q -dry_run -only_res -jobs:3 -rebuild:collision collision_pack.grp
   ```

2. Locate the daBuild logs

   ```{eval-rst}
   .. image:: _images/static_object_collision_46.jpg
     :alt: Remove degenerates
     :width: 15em
     :align: center
   ```

3. Search for "bad mesh node" entries. Errors will look like this:

   ```text
   34.67 [W] geschutz_wagen_rendinst_collision: bad mesh node "Object020" tm={(1.400,0.000,-0.000) (-0.000,-0.000,-1.400) (-0.000,1.400,-0.000) (0.000,0.000,0.000)}
   ```

### Missing Triangulation in Complex Physical Collisions

#### Causes

This issue typically occurs when:

1. Complex collision geometry has not been properly triangulated manually.
2. The geometry contains unwelded edges or problematic vertices that cannot be
   resolved automatically.
3. Cut-outs or holes in the collision mesh are left untriangulated, further
   compounding the problem.

These conditions can result in invisible barriers, preventing the player
character from moving through spaces that appear visually unobstructed. The
issue may only occur from certain directions or cause the character to get
temporarily stuck before passing through.

#### Detection Methods

Unfortunately, there is no automated way to detect this issue either in-game or
through available tools. The only reliable solution is manual inspection and
correction.

1. **Ensure clean, well-formed physical collision geometry** For example, in the
   case of a problematic stair collision, rebuilding the geometry and applying
   proper triangulation resolved the movement issue.

   ```{eval-rst}
   .. image:: _images/static_object_collision_47.jpg
     :alt: Example 1
     :width: 55em
     :align: center
   ```

2. **Manually triangulate geometry near passageways** While the root cause is
   often flawed geometry, manual triangulation in key areas, especially around
   tight walkable spaces—can frequently mitigate the problem.

   ```{eval-rst}
   .. image:: _images/static_object_collision_48.jpg
     :alt: Example 2
     :width: 55em
     :align: center
   ```

## Collision Handling in `.folder.blk`

Collision resources, like all other assets, are processed by the engine through
the `.folder.blk` configuration file. A typical collision processing block looks
like this:

```text
virtual_res_blk{
  find:t="^(.*)\.lod02\.dag$"
  className:t="collision"
  name:t="$1_collision"
}
```

In this example, `lod02` refers to the Level of Detail file used for collision.
You can substitute this with any LOD level as needed, depending on where the
collision geometry is placed.

```{eval-rst}

.. important::

   As of October 2023, the approach to collision processing has changed. We no
   longer define individual ``virtual_res{}`` blocks within ``.folder.blk`` for
   War Thunder and daNetGame-based projects.

   Instead, collision processing is handled through pre-configured files located
   at: ``<project_name>/develop/assets/``.

   These files include:

   - ``_ri_collision_lod0_continue.blk``
   - ``_ri_collision_lod0_stop.blk``
   - ``_ri_collision_lod1.blk``
   - ``_ri_collision_lod2.blk``
   - ``_ri_collision_lod3.blk``
   - ``_unit_collision_dm.blk``
   - ``_unit_collision_dynmodel_lod0_continue.blk``
   - ``_unit_collision_props.blk``

   Each file contains ``virtual_res{}`` blocks similar to those used previously,
   but now includes additional references to shared configuration files. These
   referenced files contain specific parameters required for various collision
   types (for example, different settings for render instance collisions versus
   unit collisions).

   For example:

   .. code-block:: text

      virtual_res_blk{
        find:t="^(.*)\.lod02\.dag$"
        className:t="collision"
        name:t="$1_collision"
        contents{
          include "#/develop/assets/_ri_collision_props.blk"
        }
      }

   The new system uses predefined include files to configure collision
   processing consistently across all assets. These files contain essential
   parameters such as:

   - ``collapseAndOptimize:b=yes``: Enables additional geometry optimization and
     compression during packaging.
   - ``buildFRT:b=yes``: Enables building for the FastRayTracer.

   The exact parameters are less important than the fact that they are
   automatically applied to all render instance collisions via these include
   files. To maintain this behavior **do not manually define collision
   processing using** ``virtual_res{}`` **blocks anymore**.

   To include collision processing for a specific LOD, simply add the relevant
   include file to your ``.folder.blk``. For example:

   .. code-block:: text

      include "#/develop/assets/_ri_collision_lod1.blk"

   Replace the file name as needed depending on which LOD level you are working
   with. This line can be placed anywhere in the ``.folder.blk`` file and does
   not require a ``virtual_res{}`` block.

   This approach ensures consistency, reduces redundancy, and aligns with the
   current asset pipeline.
```

### Usage Examples

**Exclusion Example:**

```text
include "#/develop/assets/_ri_collision_lod2.blk"
"@override-last"{ exclude:t ="^(.*sign.*)\.lod02\.dag$"; }
```

**Name-Based Search Example:**

```text
include "#/develop/assets/_ri_collision_lod1.blk"
"@override-last"{ "@override:find":t="^(.*pos_a.*|.*pos_b.*|.*pos_c.*|.*sign.*)\.lod01\.dag$"; }
```

In both cases, we use `@override-last` to modify the behavior of the previously
included blocks, allowing for custom exclusions or searches based on specific
patterns.
