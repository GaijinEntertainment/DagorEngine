Dagor Shading Language (``.dshl``) files are used to create data driven pre-shaders for easy C++ to HLSL data piping and permutations (pins).
The actual front end of shaders themselves is HLSL, and 'pure' HLSL functions can be found in ``.hlsl`` files or within ``hlsl { }`` blocks in ``.dshl`` files.
