Image Rasterization
--------------------

Images can be of several formats, most common TIFF, PNG, JPG and SVG.


There can also be suffixes that allow to specify parameters of rasterization, separated with ``:``::

  <image>[<:W>[:H][:k|f|p]]

  W - width
  H - height
  K - keep aspect
  F - force aspect
  P - premultiplied alpha

Width and Height can be used for svg and other format for better down/upsampling quality.
When both Width and Height are 0 then resampling is skipped (it may be useful to force premultiplied alpha leaving source picture
resolution as is using :0:P suffix). For vector graphics (such as .SVG) resolution (at least Width) is mandatory.

Sample usage (in daRg for example)::

  Picture("image.svg:256:256:K:P")
  or
  Picture("b64://<base64 encoded string of svg or png>:256:256:K:P")
  or
  Picture("image.png:0:P")
  or
  Picture("image.png:512:256:P:F")
