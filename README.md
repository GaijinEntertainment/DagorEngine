## How to Build: Environment
Requirements for building and using the Dagor Engine toolkit: Windows 10 (x64), 16 GB of RAM, 200 GB of HDD/SSD space.

* Install Git: https://git-scm.com/download/win
* Install 7-Zip: https://www.7-zip.org/
* Install Python 3
* If you plan to use the FMOD sound library, also install FMOD Studio SDK 2.02.15

Create a project folder at the root of any drive (the folder name should not contain spaces or non-Latin characters).
```
md X:\develop && cd X:\develop
```

Clone the Dagor Engine source code and samples:
```
git clone https://github.com/GaijinEntertainment/DagorEngine.git
cd DagorEngine
```

Run the `make_devtools.py` script. This script will download, install, and configure the build toolkit. You should provide the path to the build toolkit folder as an argument, and the script will create this folder if it doesn't exist.

```
python3 make_devtools.py X:\develop\devtools
```

If you are building Dagor Engine in Linux, most tools do not yet support Linux. At the moment, only the shader compiler is ported. Nevertheless, you can setup the development tools by running:

```
python3 make_devtools_linux.py
```

If the script is not run as an administrator, installers of certain programs may request permission for installation, which you should grant. If you plan to use plugins for 3ds Max, press 'Y' when the script asks if you want to install the 3ds Max SDK. The script will also ask to add the path X:\develop\devtools to the PATH environment variable and set the GDEVTOOL variable to point to this folder.

After the script completes its work, the X:\develop\devtools folder will be configured with the following SDKs and tools:

* FidelityFX_SC - a library for image quality enhancement
* fmod-studio-2.xx.xx [optional] - FMOD sound library
* LLVM-15.0.7 - C/C++ compiler and libraries (Clang)
* nasm - assembler
* max2024.sdk - 3ds Max 2004 SDK
* openxr-1.0.16 - library for AR/VR
* vc2019_16.10.3 - C/C++ compiler and libraries (MSVC)
* win.sdk.100 - Windows 10 SDK
* win.sdk.81 - Windows 8.1 SDK
* ducible.exe - a tool to make builds of Portable Executables (PEs) and PDBs reproducible
* pdbdump.exe - a tool for dumping the content of PDB files
* jam.exe - a small build tool that can be used as a replacement for Make

Restart the command line console to make the new environment variables available.

## How to Build: Prebuilt Binaries

You will need to download and extract additional binary files from the repository [https://github.com/GaijinEntertainment/DagorEngine/releases](https://github.com/GaijinEntertainment/DagorEngine/releases) into the X:\develop\DagorEngine folder:

* samples-base.7z - contains initial assets that will be compiled into binary files that will be loaded the game
* samples-prebuilt-game.7z - contains precompiled assets
* tools-prebuilt.7z - contains the prebuilt engine toolkit

The directory structure should look like this:
```
X:\develop\DagorEngine\tools\...

X:\develop\DagorEngine\samples\skiesSample\game
                              \skiesSample\develop
                              \skiesSample\prog

X:\develop\DagorEngine\samples\testGI\game
                              \testGI\develop
                              \testGI\prog
```

* prog - game source code
* develop - initial assets
* game - directory where assets are placed after building and game executable files are located

## How to Build: Build from Source Code

To build the "testGI" sample, navigate to the X:\develop\DagorEngine\samples\testGI\prog folder and run the "jam" command. After building, the executable file will be placed in the testGI\game folder.

Run DagorEngine/build_all.cmd to build the entire project toolkit from the source code. This process may take a considerable amount of time.
